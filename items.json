[{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The inspiration for this picture came during a boating expedition Sargent took on the\nThames at Pangbourne in September 1885, with the American artist Edwin Austin Abbey, during which he saw Chinese lanterns hanging among trees and lilies. He began the picture while staying at the home of the painter F.D. Millet at Broadway,\nWorcestershire, shortly after his move to Britain from Paris. At first he used the Millets's five-year-old daughter Katharine as his model, but she was soon replaced by Polly and Dorothy (Dolly) Barnard, the daughters of the illustrator Frederick\nBarnard, because they had the exact haircolour Sargent was seeking. Dolly, aged eleven, is on the left; Polly, aged seven, is on the right. A sketchbook at the Fogg Museum, Cambridge, includes Sargent's outline designs for the painting, and two\ndrawings at the Tate (Tate Gallery A00850-1) record the precise poses he required for the girls' profiles.He worked on the picture, one of the few figure compositions he ever made out of doors in the Impressionist\nmanner, from September to early November 1885, and again at the Millets's new home, Russell House, Broadway, during the summer of 1886, completing it some time in October. Sargent was able to work for only a few minutes each evening when the light was\nexactly right. He would place his easel and paints beforehand, and pose his models in anticipation of the few moments when he could paint the mauvish light of dusk. As autumn came and the flowers died, he was forced to replace the blossoms with\nartificial flowers. His friend Edmund Gosse recorded Sargent's working method: \tInstantly, he took up his place at a distance from the canvas, and at a certain notation of \tthe light ran forward over the lawn with the action of a wag-tail,\nplanting at the same time, \trapid dabs of paint on the picture, and then retiring again, only, with equal suddenness, to \trepeat the wag-tail action. All this occupied but two or three minutes, the light rapidly \tdeclining, and then, while he left the\nyoung ladies to remove his machinery, Sargent would \tjoin us again, so long as the twilight permitted, in a last turn at lawn tennis.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(quoted in Charteris, pp.74-5)Edwin Howland Blashfield, a member of the artists' colony at\nBroadway that year, recalled that when he saw the canvas each morning, the previous evening's work seemed to have been scraped off, and that this happened repeatedly at each stage. Sargent cut two feet off the left side of the canvas, leaving it\napproximately square, in order to concentrate the composition.The picture was both acclaimed and decried at the 1887 Royal Academy exhibition. The title comes from the song 'The Wreath', by the eighteenth-century composer of operas Joseph\nMazzinghi, which was popular in the 1880s. Sargent and his circle frequently sang around the piano at Broadway. The refrain of the song asks the question 'Have you seen my Flora pass this way?' to which the answer is 'Carnation, Lily, Lily,\nRose'. The picture was bought for the Tate Gallery in 1887, under the terms of the Chantrey bequest, largely at the insistence of the Royal Academy President, Sir Frederic Leighton. A portrait by Sargent of Mrs Barnard (1885), made at the same time\nas Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, is also in the Tate (Tate Gallery N05901).Further reading:The Hon.

His childhood was\nspent touring Europe, mainly in Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany. He entered the Paris studio of Carolus-Duran in 1874, where he stayed as student and assistant until 1878. He visited America in 1876, and the following year exhibited his first\nportrait at the Paris Salon. He travelled to Spain and Morocco in 1879-80, and to Haarlem in 1880, where he copied works by Velasquez and Frans Hals. He lived in Paris until 1884, then settled in London in 1885 following the stormy reception of his\nMadame Gautreau at the 1884 Paris Salon.Sargent exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery from 1882, and with the New English Art Club, of which he was a founding member, from 1886. He held a one-man exhibition at the St\nBotolph Club, Boston, Massachusetts in 1888. He exhibited at Knoedler's, New York in 1909 and 1912. He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1894, and a full member in 1897. His murals for the Boston Public Library were begun in 1891. He\ntravelled widely in Europe, and visited the Holy Land in 1905-6. Sargent's international reputation as a portraitist reached its peak in the 1890s and early 1900s, and he painted many of the distinguished personalities of his day, including the\nactress Dame Ellen Terry (Tate Gallery N02053), the art dealer Asher Wertheimer and his family (Tate Gallery N03705-13, T07104),\nCoventry Patmore and Henry James. Many of his clients were Americans: Roosevelt, Rockefeller, H.G. Marquand, and Lady Randolph Churchill. By 1910 he had given up all but the occasional portrait, devoting himself to landscapes and the murals at Boston.\nHis most important war picture, Gassed (1919), is in the Imperial War Museum, London. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, in 1924. Sargent died in London. He remained an American citizen throughout\nhis life. Memorial exhibitions of his work were held in Boston in 1925, and at the Royal Academy, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Tate Gallery in 1926.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This painting is Hogarth's comment on his second visit to France in the summer of 1748,\nwhen he was arrested as a spy while sketching the arms of England on the old city gate at Calais. The contemporary diarist George Vertue records in August 1748 that Hogarth and Francis Hayman were 'attempting to draw some Views of Fortifications &amp;c.\nwere surprized &amp; clapt into the Bastile. from whence they were soon glad to return to England' ('Vertue Note Books III', Walpole Society, vol.22, Oxford 1934, p.142). Hogarth took his revenge with this painting. The title was taken from a\npopular tune of the day, which extolled roast beef as the symbol of Britain's wealth and power. Numerous xenophobic references indicate Hogarth's low opinion of the French. The huge side of British beef at the exact centre of the picture, destined\nfor the English inn at Calais, is neatly balanced by the scrawny French soldier at the other side of the drawbridge. A fat friar, the only well-nourished Frenchman in the picture, covetously pokes the beef. In the right foreground, a starving Jacobite\nsits with his pathetic meal of an onion and a piece of bread, his overturned cup beside him. The Jacobites, the Scotsmen who fled to France after the unsuccessful Scottish rebellion of 1745, are further symbolised by the black crow which perches atop\nthe stone cross above the drawbridge. In the tableau framed by the gate, a white dove hangs on an inn sign above the cross - a satirisation of the Catholic Church. The fish-wives in the left foreground ridicule a skate whose unpleasantly human features\nresemble their own. To the left of the gate, framed by vegetables, sits Hogarth himself. As he sketches the drawbridge, the arresting officer's hand clasps his shoulder.Further reading:Elizabeth Einberg, Hogarth the\nPainter, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1997, pp.48-9, reproduced in colourTerry RiggsMarch 1998\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1748", "dimensions": "Support: 788 x 945 mm", "reference": "N01464", "title": "O the Roast Beef of Old England (\u2018The Gate of Calais\u2019)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hogarth-o-the-roast-beef-of-old-england-the-gate-of-calais-n01464", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01464_8.jpg", "artist": "William Hogarth", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1697\u20131764", "artistbio": "\n WILLIAM HOGARTH 1697\u20131764\n\nPainter of portraits, history and contemporary narrative genre, also leading engraver; first British-born artist of European standing. Born London, 10 November 1697, son of unsuccessful classics master and writer, Richard Hogarth. Son-in-law of Thornhill (q.v.).\n\nApprenticed 1714 to silversmith Ellis Gamble as ornamental engraver, worked independently from c. 1720. Enrolled in St Martin's Lane Academy in October 1720. Began painting in oils probably in late 1720s, and first noted as a serious painter after producing several versions of a scene from The Beggar's Opera of 1728. Successful throughout 1730s as accomplished painter of small-scale conversation pieces. Gained popular acclaim in 1732 with publication of engravings after the first of his \u2018modern moral subjects\u2019, \u2018The Harlot's Progress\u2019. This was followed by other series, notably \u2018The Rake's Progress\u2019 (Soane Museum) in 1735, \u2018Marriage A-la-Mode\u2019 (National Gallery) in 1745, and \u2018The Election\u2019 (Soane Museum), painted in 1754\u20135. Set up his own academy run on democratic lines in St Martin's Lane with equipment inherited from Thornhill in 1734, and was the chief instigator of the Engravers' Copyright Act of 1735. Painted his first large-scale histories for the staircase of St Bartholomew's Hospital 1735\u20136; encouraged presentation and display of works by British artists at the Foundling Hospital, where his \u2018Captain Thomas Coram\u2019 of 1740 is one of the masterpieces of portraiture on the scale of life of this period. Visited Paris in 1743, and possibly again in 1748, and much of his fluid handling of paint suggests French influence. His theoretical work The Analysis of Beauty, published 1753, was not well received and much of the remainder of his life was overshadowed by quarrels with the establishment. Exhibited at the SA 1761. Died at his house in Leicester Fields 25 or 26 October 1764; buried at Chiswick.\n\nLITERATURE Beckett 1949; Paulson 1965; Paulson 1971; Webster 1979; Bindman 1981\n\nEXHIBITIONS Hogarth, Tate Gallery 1971\n\n\nPublished in:\nElizabeth Einberg and Judy Egerton, The Age of Hogarth: British Painters Born 1675-1709, Tate Gallery Collections, II, London 1988\n\n\n\n ", "acquisition": "Presented by the Duke of Westminster 1895"},

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Some Roses and Their Phantoms, 1952, represents a domestic world transformed by mysterious eruptions and inhabited by unnamable creatures. The table top setting, with its crisp white tablecloth and marks of ironed folds, suggests a safe world of bourgeois ritual. A recurrent motif, the white table cloth can also be found in other works of the same period, for example, Poached Trout, 1952 (private collection), and Portrait de famille, 1954 (Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris), and later in Notes for an Apocalypse, 1974 (Mimi Johnson, New York). The theme of domesticity is continued in the suggestion in the foreground of a plain white plate, but this appears to lie under, or more strangely to merge into, the exquisitely painted cloth. In The Rose and the Dog, 1952 (collection of the artist), Tanning painted a single oversize rose, its petals transformed into a grey metallic forms. In Some Roses and Their Phantoms, however, the roses and their phantoms have multiplied and become mysterious, animal-like forms. One emerges from the cloth, its petals shaped like a crumpled napkin; others appear to poke through the background wall. Behind the table another rose-form surges up but resembles only a sad, misshapen creature. \n\nFor a recent exhibition of her work Tanning wrote about this painting:\n\n\nHere some roses from a very different garden sit?, lie?, stand?, gasp, dream?, die? \u2013 on white linen. They may serve you tea or coffee. As I saw them take shape on the canvas I was amazed by their solemn colors and their quiet mystery that called for \u2013 seemed to demand \u2013 some sort of phantoms. So I tried to give them their phantoms and their still-lifeness. Did I succeed? Clearly they are not going to tell me, but the white linen gave me a good feeling as if I had folded it myself, then opened it on the table.\n\n(Dorothea Tanning: Birthday and Beyond, exhibition catalogue, Philadelphia Museum of Art 2000, n.p.)\n\n\nThis painting was bought by Roland Penrose (1900-1984), the British surrealist artist and collector. Penrose had been a close friend of Max Ernst (1891-1976) from the 1920s. He and his wife Lee Miller (1907-1976) remained close friends of Tanning and Ernst, and the couples visited each other from time to time. Penrose had bought the earliest work by Tanning in Tate\u2019s collection, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, 1943 (Tate T07346), on a visit to the United States in 1946. Penrose contributed an essay to a special volume on Tanning\u2019s work produced by XXe Si\u00e8cle in 1977.\n\nIn this and other works of this period Tanning used a meticulous technique to make the imaginary seem real, albeit imbued with unnatural tones and reflections. Such works can be seen as the culmination of her early work. In the late 1950s, when she had left her home in Sedona, Arizona, and had settled in France, her work entered a freer, more abstracted phase, although still based on allusions to known forms and textures, of which Tate\u2019s A Mi-Voix, 1958 (Tate T00298), is an example.\n\nFurther reading\nXXe Si\u00e8cle: Dorothea Tanning, Paris 1977, reproduced p.80 in colour\nJean Christophe Bailly, Dorothea Tanning, New York 1995, reproduced p.79 in colour\nDorothea Tanning, Between Lives: An Artist and Her World, New York and London 2001\n\nJennifer Mundy\nMarch 2003\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1952", "dimensions": "Support: 763 x 1015 x 23 mm", "reference": "T07987", "title": "Some Roses and Their Phantoms", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tanning-some-roses-and-their-phantoms-t07987", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07987_8.jpg", "artist": "Dorothea Tanning", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1910\u20132012", "artistbio": "\n Dorothea Tanning born 1910American Surrealist painter and sculptor.

In 1910 he became a rent collector and clerk with the Pall Mall Property Company in Manchester; he remained a full-time employee and eventually chief cashier until his retirement in 1952. Despite his unusually long period as an art student, he regarded himself as self-taught.

Lowry remained unconcerned by his growing fame and commercial success; from 1948 until his death he lived in the same small, unmodernised house in Cheshire.\nAlthough Lowry is chiefly associated with street scenes and townscapes, his subject-matter was far more wide-ranging. He painted country scenes, as well as views of the seaside and of harbours. Though often represented as a reclusive man, his affection for relatives and close friends is shown in the Portrait of the Artist's Mother (1910; Salford, Mus. &amp; A.G.). Occasionally he touched on current affairs, for example in Blitzed Site (1942; Salford, Mus. &amp; A.G.), depicting the damage caused by a German air raid on Manchester in World War II, although recording events of this sort was never one of his main interests. \nBibliographyL.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In Modern Painters (1847) the writer and critic John Ruskin (1819-1900) exhorted young English artists to 'go to Nature in all singleness of heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly, having no other thoughts but how best to penetrate her meaning, and remember her instructions; rejecting nothing, selecting nothing, and scorning nothing; believing all things to be right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth.' Following Ruskin's dictum that art in its truthfulness can teach a moral lesson, William Holman Hunt created his greatest and most Pre-Raphaelite landscape. \n\nThe picture was first commissioned as a replica of the sheep in the background of The Hireling Shepherd (1851-2, City of Manchester Art Galleries), which was bought by the eminent naturalist W.J. Broderip. The copy was destined for Broderip's cousin, Charles T. Maud, but Hunt apparently persuaded him that an original picture would be more desirable. \n\nThe location for the picture was the Lover's seat, a well-known beauty spot perched on the cliffs overlooking Covehurst Bay, near Hastings. Hunt has paid scrupulous attention to natural detail, but the cliffs, sheep and parts of the foreground were all painted from different viewpoints, and the butterflies in the left foreground were painted indoors from a live specimen.\n\nHunt exhibited the picture at the Royal Academy in 1853 with the title Our English Coasts. The critic F.G. Stephens, a former member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, later suggested that the painting 'might be taken as a satire on the reported defenseless state of the country against foreign invasion' (William Holman Hunt and His Works, 1860, p.23). During this period fears of an invasion had been generated by the press, reacting to Napoleon III's autocratic r\u00e9gime in France. The original frame bore the inscription 'The Lost Sheep', and when Hunt sent the painting to the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855 he changed the title to Strayed Sheep, thus underlining the picture's religious symbolism. However, critics of the time were struck less by the picture's symbolism than by the treatment of light. Ruskin wrote in 1883 that 'It showed to us, for the first time in the history of art, the absolutely faithful balances of colour and shade by which actual sunshine might be transposed into a key in which the harmonies possible with material pigments should yet produce the same impressions upon the mind which were caused by the light itself' (quoted in Parris, p.108).\n\nFurther reading:Leslie Parris (ed), The Pre-Raphaelites, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1984, reprinted 1994, pp.106-8, reproduced p.107, in colour.Elizabeth Prettejohn, The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites, London 2000, pp.177-8, reproduced p.177, in colour.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, London 1999, pp.129-30, reproduced p.127, in colour.\n\nFrances FowleDecember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1852", "dimensions": "Support: 432 x 584 mm", "reference": "N05665", "title": "Our English Coasts, 1852 (\u2018Strayed Sheep\u2019)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hunt-our-english-coasts-1852-strayed-sheep-n05665", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05665_8.jpg", "artist": "William Holman Hunt", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1827\u20131910", "artistbio": "\n Hunt was born in London, the son of a warehouse manager.

He exhibited at the Royal Manchester Institution from 1845, and at the Royal Academy and the British Institution from 1846. In September 1848, with D.G. Rossetti and Millais, he\nformed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The group's stated aims were: \t1, To have genuine ideas to express; 2, to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to \texpress them; 3, to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in\nprevious \tart, \tto the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote; \tand 4, and \tmost indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.\t(William Michael Rossetti, ed., Dante Gabriel Rossetti: His\nFamily-Letters, with a \tMemoir, London 1895, I, p.135)In 1850 Hunt exhibited A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) at the Royal Academy; it\nwas sold to Thomas Combe, who become his major patron, friend and business adviser. In 1852 he sold The Hireling Shepherd (City of Manchester Art Galleries), his first work to display his new style of symbolic realism which was intended to\nexpressed Christian ideals. His 1853 Royal Academy exhibits attracted the attention of Thomas Fairbairn, who commissioned him to complete The Awakening Conscience (1853, Tate Gallery T02075). Hunt\nleft England for Egypt in January 1854, spending two years in the Holy Land. The major painting to result from this stay was The Scapegoat (1854-5, Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight). He contributed to Moxon's edition of Tennyson's\nPoems in 1857. In 1865 he married Fanny Waugh. They left England for the East in August 1866; however while in quarantine detention in Florence Fanny gave birth to a son, contracted miliary fever and died. Hunt returned to England in September\n1867. The following year he travelled back to Florence to work on a memorial to Fanny.Hunt was elected a member of the Old Water-Colour Society in 1869. He visited Jerusalem in August of that year. In 1875 he married Fanny's sister Edith, and\nreturned to Jerusalem, where he began The Triumph of the Innocents (see Tate Gallery T03321, N03334). He returned to London in 1878, preferring to exhibit at the\nGrosvenor and New Galleries (1877-99) or in one-picture exhibitions, rather than with the Royal Academy. His first retrospective was held in London in 1886, and was accompanied by the publication of his series of articles on the Pre-Raphaelite\nBrotherhood in the Contemporary Review. He visited the Middle East for the last time in 1892. By the end of the century his eyesight had deteriorated. In 1905 he was awarded the Order of Merit and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law by Oxford\nUniversity. His memoirs were published that year. A series of one-man shows was held in 1906-7, in London, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. In 1907 his painting The Ship (1875, Tate Gallery N02120) was\nbought by a group of his friends and presented to the Tate Gallery to commemorate the artist's eightieth birthday.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is a full-size oil sketch for the painting now in the Paul Mellon Collection at the\nYale Center for British Art. Constable submitted the finished work to the Royal Academy exhibition in 1829, the year in which he was elected an Academician. He began painting six-foot canvases in 1818, in emulation of the works of the past masters of\nlandscape such as Claude, Poussin and Rubens. He saw these large pictures as a means to gain further recognition as an artist, and to elevate what many considered the mundane subject matter of rural scenery. Unable to paint from nature on this scale, he\nturned increasingly to invention, and these large studio sketches enabled him to work out the compositional problems he was encountering in the preparation of his exhibition pieces. The oil sketch would be made either prior to, or simultaneously with,\nthe finished picture.Constable made a small pencil sketch of Hadleigh Castle near Southend in Essex in 1814, on his only visit to the area, when he wrote to his future wife Maria: 'At Hadleigh there is a ruin of a castle which from its situation is\na really fine place - it commands a view of the Kent hills, the Nore and North Foreland &amp; looking many miles to sea' (letter of 3 July 1814; in R.B. Beckett, ed., John Constable's Correspondence, II, Ipswich 1964, p.127). He returned to the\npencil sketch fifteen years later, to develop the six-foot painting. He made a small preparatory oil sketch, probably in 1828 (Paul Mellon Collection, Upperville, Virginia), based on the drawing, but with the addition of a shepherd and his flock at the\nbottom left. In a pen and ink drawing made at around the same time (collection David Thomson), the composition has become decidedly more horizontal, having been extended on the right to include the distant Kent shore. A dog has replaced the shepherd's\nflock, and a tree has been added beside the castle's left-hand tower. The Tate's large oil sketch introduces cows in the middle-distance and gulls flying above the sea.Constable's wife Maria died in November 1828, and the sombre, desolate tone of\nthe work is generally assumed to reflect his mood at this time. In a letter of 19 December of that year, he wrote to his brother Golding: 'I shall never feel again as I have felt, the face of the World is totally changed to me' (in C.R. Leslie, ed.\nHon. Andrew Shirley, Memoirs of the Life of John Constable, R.A., London 1937, p.234).Further reading:Leslie Parris and Ian Fleming-Williams, Constable, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1991, pp.243,\n312-14, 355, reproduced in colour p.313Terry RiggsFebruary 1998\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1828\u20139", "dimensions": "Support: 1226 x 1673 mm", "reference": "N04810", "title": "Sketch for \u2018Hadleigh Castle\u2019", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/constable-sketch-for-hadleigh-castle-n04810", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N04/N04810_8.jpg", "artist": "John Constable", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1776\u20131837", "artistbio": "\n Constable was born at East Bergholt, Suffolk, the son of a corn and coal merchant and farmer. He devoted\nmuch of his life to painting the local landscape, the scenes of his 'careless boyhood' which, he said, 'made me a painter' (in R.B. Beckett, ed., John Constable's Correspondence, VI, Ipswich 1968, p.78). He went to work for his father in\nthe family business about 1792. In 1794 he made a sketching tour of Norfolk. He made his first etchings in 1797. In 1799 Constable was introduced to Joseph Farington, RA, and entered the Royal Academy Schools. He visited Staffordshire and Derbyshire in\n1801. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1802. He received a commission in 1805 to paint an altarpiece for the church at Brantham. He toured the Lake District in 1806. In 1810 he began work for an altarpiece for Nayland Church.Constable began\nto see his future wife, Maria Bicknell (see Maria Bicknell, Mrs John Constable, 1816 Tate Gallery N02655) regularly from 1809, although they had met some years earlier. They married in 1816, despite\nopposition from her family, and eventually had seven children. They moved to Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, London in 1817. From 1819, because of his wife's ill health, Constable rented a house for his family at Hampstead, making about a hundred studies of\ncloud formations, many oil sketches of Hampstead views, and several 'finished' works on the spot (see Hampstead Heath, with the House Called 'The Salt Box', c.1819-20, Tate Gallery N01236).\nThey lived in Joseph Farington's former house in Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury from 1822. In 1824 they began going to Brighton for reasons of Maria's health. She died of tuberculosis in 1828. In a letter to his brother Golding of 19 December, Constable\nwrote, 'I shall never feel again as I have felt, the face of the World is totally changed to me' (in C.R. Leslie, ed. A. Shirley, Memoirs of the Life of John Constable, R.A., London 1937, p.234).Constable exhibited regularly at the British\nInstitution from 1808, at the Liverpool Academy 1813-14, at the Birmingham Society of Arts from 1829, and at the Worcester Institution 1834-6. He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1819, and a Royal Academician in 1829. The Hay-Wain\n(1820-1, National Gallery, London) was one of three of his works shown at the Paris Salon in 1824 and earned him a gold medal from Charles X. In 1826 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society of Fine Arts, Lille, France, following exhibits at its\nSalon. Friendship with the Fisher family, especially Archdeacon John Fisher, took him to Salisbury in 1811, 1820, 1823 and 1829. The first edition of English Landscape, a series of prints after his work by David Lucas, was published 1830-2.\nBetween 1833 and 1836 Constable lectured on landscape painting at the Royal Institution, the Hampstead Literary and Scientific Society, and the Worcester Athenaeum. He visited West Sussex in 1834 and 1835. He died in Bloomsbury, and was buried in the\nchurchyard of St John's, Hampstead.Further reading:C.R. Leslie, ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Quattro Stagioni is a cycle of four paintings representing the four seasons. Tate\u2019s version is the second of two cycles; the first is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Both cycles were begun in 1993 at Twombly\u2019s studio in Bassano in Teverina (north of Rome) and completed in 1994 at another house owned by the artist in Gaeta on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Born and bred in Lexington, Virginia, Twombly was deeply influenced by Modern European art, particularly twentieth century European painting, and moved to Italy in 1957. Since that date he has worked in Rome and various locations in Italy and the United States as well as travelling widely around the Mediterranean. Throughout his career, Twombly\u2019s paintings have been based on two components \u2013 line and paint. In such early works as Panorama\n1955 (Daros Collection, Switzerland), a monotone grey canvas is covered in irregular chalk scribbles which hover on the verge of becoming recognisable as letters or ciphers. In the 1960s, daubs, smears and drips of colourful paint applied with a brush, the brush handle and the tips of the artist\u2019s fingers begin to supersede the crayon and graphite marks of his earlier paintings. In some paintings, such as August Notes from Rome 1961 (Hirshorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institute, Washington DC), line is almost completely replaced by colourful patches of paint; in others, such as Leda and the Swan 1961 (collection the artist), it is a source of violent energy. Since the mid 1970s, the linear marks frequently take the form of text, introducing a third component: written language. Clumsy capitals or scrawled cursive letters are mixed with doodled shapes and indecipherable scribbles usually in compositional balance with painted elements. The tension between the graphic qualities of linear inscription and the sensual materiality of paint is central to the impact of the work. This runs parallel to a tension between intellectual cultural history and intuitive emotional expression enacted in Twombly\u2019s paintings. Classical mythology, literature and historical works of art are appropriated and translated into a visual response which is tactile, visceral and aesthetic. His particular reference to Greek and Roman myths evokes an archaic symbolism, a subject he shares with the American Abstract Expressionists. A generation younger, he is further connected to this movement by his expressive, \u2018gestural\u2019 use of paint. \n\nTwombly\u2019s representations of the four seasons are typical to his production of the late 1980s and 1990s in which light has become a principal theme. His prominent use of white echoes that of French Impressionists such as Claude Monet (1840-1926) for whom it was an important ingredient in the depiction of light. A series of nine paintings, Untitled 1988 (Cy Twombly Gallery, Houston), portraying the green reflective surfaces of a watery pool, recalls Monet\u2019s celebrated paintings of his water garden at Giverny, France created between 1899 and 1926. Plant life and the sea also recur in Twombly\u2019s imagery of this period. A single work is frequently made up of several parts, as in Quattro Stagioni which is subtitled A Painting in Four Parts. The four seasons as symbols of the natural cycles of birth and death are a classical theme in poetry, music and painting. In Twombly\u2019s Quattro Stagioni strong colours evoking the brilliance of the Mediterranean light are combined with scrawled poetic fragments from several sources. After pre-priming the canvases with cream-coloured gesso, the artist pinned them to the wall and applied individual colours, allowing the paint to dribble down in long, vertical lines. Autunno, or autumn, represents the third season of the year. The idea for the cycle began with this season, inspired by the wine harvest in Bassano in Teverina. Appropriately for the season, the colours in this painting are the richest in the group. The title is painted in irregular, dripping brown capitals near the top of the painting. Patches of deep greens, reds and browns blend with smears of dark blue, violet and yellow. On the left, stalks tipped with berries drawn with dark crayon emerge from clusters of muddy brown paint smeared with the artist\u2019s finger tips. Placed in a vertical line above a thickly painted green area, the clusters of brown paint and their long drips form a dark margin on the side of the painting. Other finger smears and prints in red and green appear near a central formation of mixed, smeared colours. Near this, round patches of red extend towards the right with long, horizontal projections, echoing the direction of the stalks and suggesting movement. This appearance of sideways movement across the canvas dramatically counterbalances the sense of verticality created by the long drips. White paint, used to cover marks and text, has been applied more sparingly than in other paintings in the cycle. The words \u2018your blood\u2019 may be distinguished, half concealed by streaks and dribbles. Other text is too fragmented to be legible.\n\n\nFurther reading:\nHeiner Bastian: Cy Twombly: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of the Paintings, volume IV 1972-1995, Munich 1995, pp.34-5 and 178, reproduced p.179 in colour\nDemosthenes Davvetas, Roberta Smith and Harald Szeemann, Cy Twombly: Paintings, Works on Paper, Sculpture, exhibition catalogue, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London and St\u00e4dtische Kunsthalle, D\u00fcsseldorf 1987\nKirk Varnedoe, Cy Twombly: A Retrospective, exhibition catalogue, Museum of Modern Art, New York 1994, pp.162-5\n\nElizabeth Manchester \nMay 2003\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint, oil paint, crayon and graphite on canvas", "date": "1993\u20135", "dimensions": "Support: 3136 x 2150 x 35 mm", "reference": "T07889", "title": "Quattro Stagioni: Autunno", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/twombly-quattro-stagioni-autunno-t07889", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07889_8.jpg", "artist": "Cy Twombly", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1928\u20132011", "artistbio": "\n American painter, draughtsman, printmaker and sculptor. He studied from 1948 to 1951. In 1951\u20132 he spent a semester at Black mountain college, an important period for his involvement with Abstract Expressionism. Action painting, in particular, became his point of departure for the development of a highly personal \u2018handwriting' that served as a vehicle for literary content. \nIn Untitled (1952; Basle, Kstmus.) Twombly used long brushstrokes in contrasting tones against a dark background, only to paint partly over them again. This alternation between the visible and the hidden has been interpreted as a struggle between memory and oblivion.\nIn the mid 1950s Twombly began working also in chalk and pencil, and his paintings assumed a more graphic character. The stylistic changes in his paintings were subsequently registered more or less simultaneously in his prolific production of drawings and prints. The potential of gestural brushwork as a form of handwriting was not exploited by Twombly until he settled in Rome and found inspiration in classical landscapes and literature. \nIn the 1960s Twombly made particular use of subjective, erotic signs in his paintings, and he began to use more intense and denser colours. \nFrom 1976 Twombly again produced sculptures, lightly painted in white, suggestive of Classical forms. In the mid 1970s Twombly began to evoke landscape through colour (favouring brown, green and light blue), written inscriptions and collage elements, often distributing these features across the surface by means of right angles that emphasize the legibility of the image and its narrative character. \nBibliographyH.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Hamilton has made three diptych paintings relating to the 'troubles' in Northern\nIreland. The citizen, 1981-3 (Tate Gallery T03980), depicts a blanketman, a republican detainee at the Maze Prison. Blanketmen, in protest at their non-political status, refused to wear prison-issue clothing\nor obey prison regulations, and lived in their own squalor. The subject, 1988-90, (Tate Gallery T06774), represents a parading loyalist Orangeman. The state, 1993, shows a British soldier on patrol\nin Northern Ireland. The state, Hamilton's image of the patrolling British soldier, expresses the unease of the army's equivocal position between the two warring groups in Northern Ireland, and the dual role the soldiers must play. The\nsoldier is at once gun-wielding and defensive. Hamilton wanted to create the effect, in this picture, of the soldier walking backwards. It is a customary practice for British soldiers patrolling in Northern Ireland to walk back to back, some 100 yards\napart, to ensure that they are covered in both directions. This idea also relates to the artist's perception that the British wish to get out of Northern Ireland. He represents the soldier as young and reluctant, a 'conscript'. Before Hamilton's\nbirth, his father served in the British army during an earlier phase of the Irish troubles and conveyed to his son a sense of the warmth of the Irish people.Hamilton's image of the British 'Tommy', who is seen against an urban background, recalls\nboth the machine-filled street of the 'abstract' left-hand panel of The subject and, in the wriggling patterns of the camouflage battle dress, the curvilinear configurations in the equivalent panel in The citizen. On a signboard\nbehind the soldier is the legend 'Spuds', the English vernacular for the potato, a vegetable particularly associated with Ireland. The word is also used by Cockney Londoners to refer to Irish people. The left-hand 'abstract' panel of The\nstate is the rural Irish landscape, evoking an alternative setting for the British troops which is no less threatening than that of the city in the right-hand panel.Hamilton's use of trompe l'oeil in the treatment of the battle dress\nreflects the ambiguity of the soldier's situation.

The camouflage markings applied to his face heighten his uneasy expression, joining with his clothes and\nvisored helmet to link this painting with its two companion pictures in a theme common to many of Hamilton's works, that of the roles of costume and artifice in the presentation of the human image.

He was educated at the Royal Academy Schools from 1938 to 1940, then studied\nengineering draughtsmanship at a Government Training Centre in 1940, then worked as a 'jig and tool' designer. He returned in 1946 to the Royal Academy Schools, from which he was expelled for 'not profiting from the instruction being given in the\npainting school' (Hamilton, p.10), then attended the Slade School of Art from 1948 to 1951. An exhibition of his engravings was held at Gimpel Fils, London, in 1950. These were inspired by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's 1913 text On Growth and\nForm which had been republished in 1942 and was a seminal influence on Hamilton's early work. Hamilton devised and designed the exhibitions Growth and Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951, and Man, Machine and\nMotion at the Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1955. He exhibited at the Hanover Gallery in 1955, and participated in This is Tomorrow at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1956, for which he produced\na collage entitled Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? for the poster and catalogue. With Victor Pasmore in 1957 he devised and organised an Exhibit, at the Hatton Gallery and the Institute of\nContemporary Arts. Hamilton was a member of the Independent Group, formed in the 1950s by a group of artists and writers at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, whose symposiums contributed to the development of Pop art in Britain. He was one of the\nprime practitioners of the critic Lawrence Alloway's theory of a 'fine/pop art continuum'. Hamilton interpreted this as meaning that 'all art is equal - there was no hierarchy of value. Elvis was to one side of a long line while Picasso was strung\nout on the other side ... TV is neither less nor more legitimate an influence than, for example, is New York Abstract Expressionism' (Hamilton, p.31).Hamilton taught at the London Central School of Arts and Crafts and University of Newcastle upon\nTyne; he gave up teaching full-time in 1966. He designed a typographic version of Duchamp's Green Box, published in 1960, and in 1965-6, with Duchamp's guidance, reconstructed Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even (The\nLarge Glass) (Tate Gallery T02011). Keen to embrace certain types of technology within his art, Hamilton began creating computer-generated works in the 1980s. He has had a long career as a print-maker, and\nin 1983 won the World Print Council Award. In 1991 he married the artist Rita Donagh. Retrospective exhibitions of Hamilton's work have been held at the Hanover Gallery, 1964, the Tate Gallery, 1970 and 1992, and abroad. He was Britain's\nrepresentative at the 1993 Venice Biennale.Further reading:Richard Hamilton, Collected Words, London 1982Richard Morphet (ed.), Richard Hamilton, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1992Terry\nRiggsDecember 1997\n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1993"},

His father, an Italian political refugee, was a poet and Dante scholar and\nfrom 1831 Professor of Italian at King's College, London. His mother, who was half Italian and half English, was a private teacher. His sister Christina (1830-94) later became a poet. He entered Sass's Drawing Academy probably in late summer 1841. He\njoined the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer in 1844, becoming a full student in December 1845. By 1847 he was considering careers in both poetry and painting. He was briefly a pupil of Ford Madox Brown in March 1848. In August 1848 he moved\nwith William Holman Hunt to a studio in Cleveland Street and around September that year founded, with Holman Hunt and J.E. Millais, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He finished his translation of Dante's Vita Nuova in October 1848. He exhibited\nhis first major oil painting, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate Gallery N04872), at the Free Exhibition in March 1849. In September and October of that year he visited Paris and Flanders with Holman\nHunt, and was greatly impressed by mediaeval and Renaissance art. He probably met his future wife and frequent model Elizabeth Siddall late in 1849; they married in 1860. He was largely responsible for the Pre-Raphaelite magazine The Germ,\npublished in 1850. In April 1850 he exhibited Ecce Ancilla Domini! (Tate Gallery N01210) at the National Institution, but rarely showed in public thereafter following the picture's negative reception.\nFrom 1854 he was friendly with the critic John Ruskin, who was instrumental in bringing the Pre-Raphaelites to public attention, and in 1855-6 with the poet Robert Browning. In 1855 he went to Paris to see the Exposition Universelle. In 1856 he met\nEdward Coley Burne-Jones and William Morris; he was a contributor to Morris's Oxford and Cambridge Magazine. Five of his illustrations were included in Moxon's edition of Tennyson's Poems (published 1857). He showed eight works in\nthe private Pre-Raphaelite exhibition, held at Russell Place in July 1857. Also that year he worked on the Oxford Union murals, during which time he met Jane Burden. Jane married William Morris but she and Rossetti had an intimate relationship which\nspanned decades, and she posed for some of Rossetti's best-known paintings (see Proserpine, 1874, Tate Gallery N05064). In 1858 Rossetti founded the Hogarth Club, an exhibiting and social club, with\nMadox Brown and others. Around this time he met Fanny Cornforth, who became his primary model and mistress for the next decade. Rossetti's translation of The Early Italian Poets was published in 1861. In 1862 Elizabeth Siddall died from an\noverdose of laudanum. The artist visited Belgium with his brother William in 1863, and was in Paris in 1864. In 1865 he met Alexa Wilding, who became an important model for him. From the mid-1860s he began suffering from eye trouble and insomnia, and\nshowed signs of paranoia. In October 1869 he exhumed his wife's coffin to retrieve his Poems, which were published in 1870. His health broke down in 1872 and he abandoned most of his old friendships. He spent long periods at Jane and William\nMorris's Kelmscott Manor between 1871 and 1874. A new edition of Poems was published in 1881 together with Ballads and Sonnets.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Chatterton is Wallis's earliest and most famous work. The picture created a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856, accompanied by the following quotation from Marlowe: \n\n\n\n Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight\n\nAnd burned is Apollo's laurel bough.\n\nRuskin described the work in his Academy Notes as 'faultless and wonderful'.\n\nThomas Chatterton (1752-70) was an 18th Century poet, a Romantic figure whose melancholy temperament and early suicide captured the imagination of numerous artists and writers. He is best known for a collection of poems, written in the name of Thomas Rowley, a 15th Century monk, which he copied onto parchment and passed off as mediaeval manuscripts. Having abandoned his first job working in a scrivener's office he struggled to earn a living as a poet. In June 1770 he moved to an attic room at 39 Brooke Street, where he lived on the verge of starvation until, in August of that year, at the age of only seventeen, he poisoned himself with arsenic. Condemned in his lifetime as a forger by influential figures such as the writer Horace Walpole (1717-97), he was later elevated to the status of tragic hero by the French poet Alfred de Vigny (1797-1863).\n\nWallis may have intended the picture as a criticism of society's treatment of artists, since his next picture of note, The Stonebreaker (1858, Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery), is one of the most forceful examples of social realism in Pre-Raphaelite art. The painting alludes to the idea of the artist as a martyr of society through the Christ-like pose and the torn sheets of poetry on the floor. The pale light of dawn shines through the casement window, illuminating the poet's serene features and livid flesh. The harsh lighting, vibrant colours and lifeless hand and arm increase the emotional impact of the scene. A phial of poison on the floor indicates the method of suicide. Following the Pre-Raphaelite credo of truth to nature, Wallis has attempted to recreate the same attic room in Gray's Inn where Chatterton had killed himself. The model for the figure was the novelist George Meredith (1828-1909), then aged about 28. Two years later Wallis eloped with Meredith's wife, a daughter of the novelist Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866).\n\nTwo preparatory drawings exist for the picture, both in the Tate collection (Tate http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/AWork?id=15908T01721 and http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/AWork?id=15909T01722.).\n\nFurther reading:Leslie Parris, Ed., The Pre-Raphaelites, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1984, reprinted 1994, pp.142-144, reproduced p.143, in colour.Elizabeth Prettejohn, The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites, London 2000, pp.192-3, reproduced p.193, in colour.Christopher Wood, The Pre-Raphaelites, London 1994, pp.61-4, reproduced p.68, in colour.\n\nFrances FowleDecember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1856", "dimensions": "Support: 622 x 933 mm", "reference": "N01685", "title": "Chatterton", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wallis-chatterton-n01685", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01685_8.jpg", "artist": "Henry Wallis", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1830\u20131916", "artistbio": "\n English painter, writer and collector. He specialised in portraits of literary figures and scenes from the lives of past writers. His first great success was the Death of Chatterton (London, Tate). He depicted the poet dead in his London garret, the floor strewn with torn fragments of manuscript and, tellingly, an empty phial near his hand. The painting was universally praised. Although Wallis was only loosely connected with the Pre-Raphaelite movement, his method and style in Chatterton reveal the importance of that connection: the vibrant colours and careful build-up of symbolic detail are typical Pre-Raphaelite concerns.\nWallis's next success came in 1858 with the exhibition at the Royal Academy of The Stonebreaker (Birmingham, Mus. &amp; A.G.). Its theme was the human cost of hard labour and poverty. It showed a dead stone-breaker slumped by the roadside in a symbolically twilit landscape. Although Wallis was not the first to portray such hardships, his painting attracted much attention through its combination of shocking realism and glorious sunset.\nHe travelled widely in Europe and the Near East; many of his later paintings show scenes or events apparently witnessed during the course of his travels. In late life he made less impact as a painter than he did as an authority on Italian and oriental ceramics, about which during the last two decades of his life he wrote a number of books and articles, many of them illustrated by his own drawings.\nBibliographyA. van de Put: \u2018Henry Wallis, 1830\u20131916', Faenza, v (1917), pp. 33\u20138The Pre-Raphaelites (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Polke\u2019s work may be understood as an analysis of the mark-making central to two-dimensional representation. From his earliest practice he emphasised a dynamic tension between expressive gesture, often humorously subverting its traditional subjectivity, and mechanical reproduction. His paintings combine found printed images with more organically-made painterly marks. He uses half-tone photography from newspapers and magazines, enlarging and reproducing it on canvas, often corrupting the original beyond recognition. From 1964 he began overlaying imagery on printed fabrics, creating a double layer of patterning and undermining the traditional relationship between subject and background. More recently he has been painting on transparent fabric, through which the structural support of the wooden stretchers is clearly visible. Triptych 2002 was made in this manner.\n\n\n\nThe central panel of Triptych was painted in 1997 and illustrated in the catalogue for an exhibition Polke had at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin in that year. It is flanked by two further panels made in 2002 and was formed into a triptych by the artist for his exhibition, Recent Paintings and Drawings 1998-2002, touring Dallas Museum of Art and Tate Modern (2002-4). Each of the three panels is painted in a similar manner. Thick layers of translucent resin have been applied to a transparent support, through which the structural support of the wooden stretcher is clearly visible. Polke then poured quantities of white, green and red paint directly on to the support, tilting the canvas to enable the liquid paint to flow and drip across the surface. This technique is entirely characteristic of many paintings Polke has made during the past two decades. The flow in this triptych, however, is contained within a final layer of imagery based on a greatly enlarged black and white half-tone grid, taken from a found illustration. In this triptych, unlike others he painted from the mid-1980s onwards, these expansive qualities are held in tight check by the rigorous pattern of the half-tone grid, making this triptych more than any of his others a work about the countervailing forces of chaotic flow versus ordering pattern.\n\nPolke began this work while he was working on his series of \u2018Printing Errors\u2019, a large group of paintings he made between 1996 and 1998. These examined, much enlarged, the minute ink slippages and spillages that read as errors on the printed page. Polke made others by manipulating photocopies during the copying process to create distortions of the image he was copying. Some errors, moreover, bore close resemblances to details in the images in which they occur. The half-tone printing technique converts the visual image into a pattern of even-sized units, in this case a dotted diamond pattern. The greater or lesser quantity of black introduced into each unit reads as a tonal value. At normal printed scale these variations translate into a black and white image. \n\nPolke\u2019s overt reference to industrial printing processes recall the Pop paintings of American Roy Lichtenstein (1923-97) whose use of benday dots in such comic strip paintings as Whaam! 1963 (Tate T00897) bears similarities to Polke\u2019s use of half-tone texture in such paintings as Girlfriends 1965 (Froehlich Collection, Stuttgart, see Tate P78769 for the print based on this painting). In the same way, in the 1960s British artist Richard Hamilton (born 1922) examined printing processes by enlarging details of photographs in such paintings as Whitley Bay 1965 (private collection), People 1965-6 (collection the artist) and the related print, People 1968 (Tate P01019).\n\nFurther Reading:\nJohn R.

In 1963 Polke launched Capitalist Realism in response to Pop art, exhibiting the first works in this genre in D\u00fcsseldorf. Polke took as his motifs such ordinary food items as chocolate, sausages or biscuits, isolating them and apparently depriving them of their tactility in order to elevate them to the status of aesthetic signs. \nSuch Pop-related images, pictured in various combinations and in a number of techniques, became from this time standard elements of Polke's work. The scattered dots in more complex works form a virtually abstract pattern that makes the imagery almost invisible when viewed from near the surface. Graphic alterations help to increase this sense of unfamiliarity, blurring the boundary between the objective reproduction of reality and the subjective production of art.\nA different process was used for the Fabric Pictures. In these Polke used printed fabrics, which in their triviality reveal the tastelessness of everyday life, as background patterns for gestures and motifs drawn from earlier art and especially from mainstream modernism. Irreconcilable images are brought together. He continued to appropriate images and techniques from other artists and found materials.\nIn other paintings Polke introduced another variation of his attack on conventional ideas about individuality and innate creativity by altering the lines of his own palm. \nPolke's love of experiment, of abrupt stylistic changes and of contradiction, irony and mocking distance thus remained essential to his uncategorisable and innovative art.\nBibliographySigmar Polke: Original und Faelschung (exh. cat. by D.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nThis unfinished, life-size sketch in oil paint represents the seventeen year-old Emma Hart (baptised as Emy Lyon, also known as Emily Lyon and Emma Lyon, later Lady Hamilton; 1765\u20131815) in the character of the sorceress Circe from Greek mythology. Hart wears loose white drapery exposing her throat and chest, her auburn hair piled \u2018high\u2019 in a top-knot whipped by the wind, with loose hair trailing over her bare shoulder. She stares directly outwards, her face tilted slightly downwards and her mouth opened a little in a pronounced pout. Her features are fully realised in paint, while her costume and hair are loosely brushed in and the background is very roughly sketched with apparently arbitrary brush strokes of earth colour animating the canvas; the several long, vertical strokes of white paint on the right indicate in a very approximate way the intended position of the sitter's left arm. The rough surface of the hessian fabric used as the painting\u2019s support breaks up many of these brushstrokes, enhancing the impression of swift, almost reckless execution. This painting was among the first of Romney\u2019s numerous portraits of Emma Hart painted over the succeeding nine years, which often represent her as characters from myth and literature. These have become the works for which Romney is best known, as Emma Hart\u2019s complex and extremely public love life (most famously her later romance with Admiral Nelson while married to the aged Sir William Hamilton) has been mythologised by numerous biographies and historical studies.\nThe painting arose in connection with the sustained series of sittings Hart (referred to in Romney\u2019s notes as \u2018Mrs Hart\u2019) made to Romney in his house in Cavendish Square, London, in the summer of 1782. Hart had become the mistress of the aristocratic politician and collector Charles Greville (1749\u20131809) in April of that year, moving into his home at Edgware Row, Paddington, and had already sat to Romney for a portrait (later engraved as \u2018Nature\u2019). The further sittings in the summer resulted in this painting and a closely-related full-length portrait of Hart as Circe (Waddesdon, The Rothschild Collection [Rothschild Family Trust]). The latter shows her holding in her right hand a long wand pointed towards the ground and with her left arm raised straight upwards, fingers outstretched as if casting a spell or invoking spirits. The art historian Alex Kidson, the leading modern authority on Romney, interprets this picture as a \u2018study\u2019 for the full-length painting, prepared spontaneously from the life and marking a \u2018charged confrontation between artist and model\u2019 (Kidson 2002, p.167). Hart was from a humble provincial background but was also a famously sensual beauty, already an unmarried mother (she had given birth to her daughter, in April 1782) and now swiftly installed as the lover of a wealthy older man who was not the father of that child. Romney was an established artist, but \u2018moody and introverted\u2019 according to Kidson, who posits the painting as marking a \u2018decisive, intoxicating moment\u2019 in which \u2018the difference between creative and routine portraiture crystallised in his mind, and where the full expressive potential of the rapid sketch, immediate and poetic, became manifest to him\u2019 (Kidson 2002, p.169). Whatever the psychological import of these encounters between artist and model, the resulting paintings were celebrated by contemporaries and helped enhance Romney\u2019s reputation as an artist and Hart\u2019s reputation as a highly sexualised beauty.\n\nFurther reading\nAlex Kidson, George Romney 1734\u20131802, exhibition catalogue, National Portrait Gallery, London 2002, pp.167\u20139.\nMartin MyroneOctober 2013\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1782", "dimensions": "Support: 533 x 495 mm", "reference": "N05591", "title": "Emma Hart as Circe", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/romney-emma-hart-as-circe-n05591", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05591_8.jpg", "artist": "George Romney", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1734\u20131802", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

He adopted the anonymous technique of the sign painter, dispensing with visible brushwork and distracting detail and simplifying the representation of objects to a basic black outline in order to present ordinary images as emblems of a mysterious reality. He deliberately chose subjects that seemed hackneyed or ambiguous in time: not only traditional genres but selfconsciously exotic and romantic themes and views of ruins and the Mediterranean.\nGradually Caulfield's attention shifted to the architectural elements to which he had earlier made isolated reference. Caulfield began to insert highly detailed passages in the manner of Photorealism into his characteristically stylised idiom, playing to great effect with ambiguous definitions of reality and artifice. Always a slow and exacting worker, he sustained a high level of pictorial invention. During the 1980s he again turned to a more stripped-down aesthetic, particularly in large paintings in which the precise disposition of only a few identifiable elements miraculously transforms an ostensibly abstract picture through the creation of a vivid sense of place.\nBibliographyDrawing towards Painting 2 (exh. cat. by A.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n French by birth and upbringing, Roussel moved to London after his first marriage in 1870. He was a close friend and pupil of Whistler and shared his love of Japanese art, evident here not only in the elegant kimono, casually draped over the folding chair, but in the overall treatment of space. The young girl is Hetty Pettigrew (1867-1953) who was the artist's favourite model and also posed, along with her sisters Rose and Lily, for Millais and Whistler. She met Roussel in 1884 and not only became his mistress but gave birth to his daughter. She continued to sit for him until he re-married in 1914.\n\nIn its frank nudity, flattening of forms and strong light-dark contrasts, The Reading Girl pays tribute to Edouard Manet's (1832-83) boldly subversive masterpiece, Olympia of 1863. But Roussel combines Manet's modernism with careful draughtsmanship and a more traditional classicism that looks back to J.A.D. Ingres (1780-1867). On the other hand, the subject is not presented as a classical Venus, but rather as a robust and healthy young woman, with a taste for current fashion. The discarded kimono, the model's elegant hairstyle and the folding campaign chair, are evidence of aesthetic preoccupations which align Roussel with such artists as Sir Frederic Leighton and the English Aesthetic movement. The critic Frederick Wedmore was impressed by the model's firm and youthful figure and compared the picture with 'the most health-suggesting, health-breathing of Courbets, with the most rosily robust of Caro Delvaille's (Le Sommeil fleuri), with the dreamiest Henner, with the slimmest and least material of Raphael Collin's (Flor\u00e9al)' (Frederick Wedmore, 'Th\u00e9odore Roussel', The Art Journal, 1909, p.184). \n\nDuring the 1880s British art was moving away from an elevated, Neo-Classical interpretation of the nude towards a new naturalism, regarded as a threat to moral standards. Roussel's picture was exhibited at the New English Art Club in April 1887 and caused a mild scandal. The critic for the Spectator wrote: 'Our imagination fails to conceive any adequate reason for a picture of this sort. It is realism of the worst kind, the artist's eye seeing only the vulgar outside of his model, and reproducing that callously and brutally. No human being, we should imagine, could take any pleasure in such a picture as this; it is a degradation of Art' (Spectator, 16 April 1887).\n\nFurther reading: Kenneth McConkey, British Impressionism, London 1989, p.57, reproduced p.50, in colour.\n\nFrances Fowle8 December 2000\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1886\u20137", "dimensions": "Support: 1524 x 1613 mm", "reference": "N04361", "title": "The Reading Girl", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/roussel-the-reading-girl-n04361", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N04/N04361_8.jpg", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore Roussel", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1847\u20131926", "artistbio": "\n English painter and etcher of French birth.

In 1885 he was introduced to James McNeill Whistler, and in consequence a lifelong friendship was formed. As Roussel was a member of Whistler's London circle his work in watercolour and oil was influenced by the latter in style and choice of subject-matter. His oft-quoted remark that he was a \u2018pupil of Whistler' is, however, belied by his frequently distinct style. In 1888 Whistler introduced him to the techniques of etching and drypoint, resulting in such etchings as the Sign of the \u2018White Horse', Parson's Green (c. 1893\u20134; see Rutter, pl. xxx). For the remainder of his life he relentlessly pursued the medium, even, like Whistler, designing his own special frames. Always fascinated by the theoretical and practical nature of colour science, he constantly experimented and was an early pioneer of the technique of colour etching in England, producing such works as Dawn (see Rutter, pl. xl). An exhibitor with the Royal Society of British Artists under Whistler's presidency, he also frequently exhibited with the New English Art Club and with the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and he was a founder-member of the Allied Artists' Association in 1908.\nBibliographyF.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is the second of a set of three modern-life pictures on the theme of the fallen woman. The other two (N03278 and N03280) are also in the Tate collection. They are typical of the social moralist pictures that were popular in Victorian art. \n\nThe theme of the triptych is the discovery of the woman's infidelity and its consequences. In the first scene the family are still together, and the husband has just learned of his wife's adultery. The second scene is a dimly-lit garret, five years later. The room is sparsely furnished and the few decorations include two portraits of the absent mother and father. The father has recently died and the mother has been driven out of her home, a fallen woman. The two orphaned girls comfort each other, the elder gazing sadly over the rooftops towards the moon.\n\nWhen the set of pictures was first shown at the Royal Academy in 1858, the drawing-room scene was hung between the other two. The writer and art critic John Ruskin described the three works in his Academy Notes, \n\nIn the central piece the husband discovers his wife's infidelity; he dies five years afterwards. The two lateral pictures represent the same moment of night a fortnight after his death. The same little cloud is under the moon. The two children see it from the chamber in which they are praying for their lost mother, and their mother, from behind a boat under a vault on the river shore. (John Ruskin, Academy Notes, 8 May 1858.)\n\nThe pictures were exhibited with no title, but with this subtitle, 'August the 4th - Have just heard that B - has been dead more than a fortnight, so his poor children have now lost both parents. I hear she was seen on Friday last near the Strand, evidently without a place to lay her head. What a fall hers has been!' In Victorian England a man could safely take a mistress without fear of recrimination, but for a woman to be unfaithful was an unforgivable crime. As Caroline Norton, an early feminist, wrote, 'the faults of women are visited as sins, the sins of men are not even visited as faults' (quoted in Lambourne, p.374).\n\nFurther reading:Lionel Lambourne, Victorian Painting, London 1999, pp.374-5, reproduced p.376, in colour.Christopher Wood, Victorian Painting, London 1999, pp.52-3, reproduced p.53, in colour.\n\nFrances Fowle1 December 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1858", "dimensions": "Support: 635 x 762 mm", "reference": "N03279", "title": "Past and Present, No. 2", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/egg-past-and-present-no-2-n03279", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N03/N03279_8.jpg", "artist": "Augustus Leopold Egg", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1816\u20131863", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

Egg's earliest pictures included portraits, costume pieces, subjects from Shakespeare, Scott, Cervantes, LeSage and others. Critics praised a few of his early pictures, but in general his early works were criticised for their derivative qualities.\nGoaded by this reaction, Egg produced his large, innovative and much acclaimed canvas Queen Elizabeth Discovers she Is No Longer Young (1848; priv. col.). It demonstrated his antiquarian knowledge, competent draughtsmanship and dramatic invention and earned him the position of ARA. \nBeginning in the early 1850s Egg promoted and patronised younger artists, particularly William Holman Hunt and the Pre-Raphaelites, whose style and subject-matter influenced his own works. Egg's famous triptych, exhibited untitled at the Academy in 1858, and now known as Past and Present (London, Tate), depicted the downfall of an adulterous wife and demonstrated Egg's concern with moralising serial narrative and with contemporary social issues. He frequently travelled to the south of England and to the Mediterranean for his asthma, to which he ultimately succumbed. One of his last paintings, and related to these journeys, The Travelling Companions (1862; Birmingham, Mus. &amp; A.G.; see fig.) depicts two sisters in a railway carriage on the outskirts of Menton, and reveals Egg's evolution towards a non-anecdotal art.\nBibliography[W.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nThe Dance 1988 is a large painting featuring eight figures dancing in the foreground on a moon-lit beach. The figures include a group of three women of varying ages moving in a circle holding hands, two dancing couples (including one woman who seems to be pregnant), and a woman stood alone on the left-hand side of the composition. In the background on the right-hand side of the painting is a large, steep and craggy cliff, on top of which stands an imposing fortress-like structure, depicted in silhouette against a deep blue sky filled with inky clouds and a full moon. The work has a dream-like quality, heightened by its night-time setting, the lengthy shadows cast by the figures, and by Rego\u2019s unusual use of scale, with the woman on her own appearing to be much larger than the figures alongside her.\n\nThe Dance, which at the time it was made was the largest painting the Portuguese-born British artist Paula Rego had created, was completed in London, where Rego moved permanently in 1976. Rego has claimed that the idea to \u2018paint people dancing\u2019 was suggested by her husband, the artist Victor Willing (1928\u20131988), who died shortly before The Dance was completed (quoted in Tate Liverpool 1997, p.127). Rego has also claimed that Willing suggested adding male figures to the painting, which she then based on her son Nicholas (who sat for her) and on a photograph of her husband (quoted in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, p.255).\nThe development of the composition of The Dance is recorded in eleven preparatory drawings in ink that Rego donated to Tate when the painting was acquired in 1989. These drawings show various combinations of dancing figures, from seven young women jubilantly jumping in the air (Tate T05541) to a mixed group strolling along a beach (Tate T05545), which is much closer to the final painting.\n\nThe Dance was planned to be the last painting in an exhibition of Rego\u2019s work at the Serpentine Gallery in London, alongside other works completed at this time such as Departure 1988 (which was destroyed in a warehouse fire in east London in 2004) and The Family 1988. Rego has explained, \u2018It was to have been the picture that would tie everything together, hung over the top of everything else\u2019 (quoted in Fiona Bradley, Paula Rego, London 2002, p.42). However, The Dance was not completed in time for the show, which opened in October 1988.\nMany of Rego\u2019s paintings seem to suggest mysterious narratives, frequently evoking childhood memories, family scenes, fairy tales and myths. The figures in The Dance may be seen in symbolic terms, as the curator Fiona Bradley has argued:\n\nOften interpreted autobiographically, [The Dance] plays out the ways in which a woman \u2013 the main character, larger than the others, to the left of the painting \u2013 may structure her conception of herself. The woman stands apart from the dancers, in a separate narrative and compositional space. As she looks at the viewer a variety of ways of being a woman play across the picture\u2019s surface. The three at the back form a matriarchal hierarchy, a happy triumvirate of child, mother, grandmother; a complete cycle of femininity. The other two define themselves in relation to their men \u2013 one courting, the other pregnant.\n(Fiona Bradley, \u2018Introduction: Automatic Narrative\u2019, in Tate Liverpool 1997, p.19)\n\nWhile the critic John McEwen has claimed that The Dance is \u2018wholeheartedly nostalgic, with no sense of menace or subversion\u2019 (John McEwen, Paula Rego, London 2006, p.168), Maria Manuel Lisboa, a specialist in Portuguese culture, has suggested that the shadowy structure in the top right-hand corner of the painting resembles a military fort on the Estoril coast in Caxias, situated five miles west of Lisbon, where Rego was born (Lisboa 2003, p.73). This fort was used as a prison and torture site during the Estado Novo (1933\u201374), a period of authoritarian rule in Portugal, principally led by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, who was Prime Minister from 1932 to 1968. The presence behind the dancers of this dark and oppressive building, closely associated with the violence of the Salazar regime, might be seen to add a sinister edge to the scene.\n\nFurther reading\n\nPaula Rego, exhibition catalogue, Tate Liverpool, London 1997, pp.19, 127\u201332, reproduced p.131.Maria Manuel Lisboa, Paula Rego\u2019s Map of Memory: National and Sexual Politics, Aldershot 2003, pp.71\u20134, reproduced p.72.\nPaula Rego, exhibition catalogue, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid 2007, pp.50, 255, reproduced p.93.\nAmy TobinFebruary 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on paper on canvas", "date": "1988", "dimensions": "Support: 2126 x 2740 mm", "reference": "T05534", "title": "The Dance", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rego-the-dance-t05534", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05534_8.jpg", "artist": "Paula Rego", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1935", "artistbio": "\n British painter and printmaker of Portuguese birth. She trained at the Slade School of Fine Art. There she met the English painter Victor Willing (1928\u201388) They continued to divide their time between Portugal and England until 1975. She first won acclaim in Portugal with semi-abstract paintings that sometimes included collage elements culled from her own drawings. Their satiric wit and verve of line, sometimes applied to violent or political subjects revealed gifts for story-telling that had been awakened in her as a child by folk-tales related by a great-aunt.\nIn 1976 Rego returned to London with her husband, and in the late 1970s she turned from collage to drawing directly in acrylic on paper. Using an essentially graphic style reminiscent of comic strips, she continued to produce figurative pictures that were spontaneous narratives rather than illustrations to literary texts. Her characters often took the form of animals for satirical effect. She developed a greater freedom and range of colour in her drawings, which inclined them more towards painting. In 1986 she turned to a naturalistic idiom with strongly modelled figures and a consistent light source, often in interior settings as in Snare (1987; Brit. Council Col.); similar subjects were treated in prints which effectively combined etched outlines with tonal gradations of aquatint. These psychologically charged presentations of human dramas, based in part on childhood memories, won her a wide and admiring audience. In 1989 her largest painting to that date, The Dance (2.13\u00d72.74m), was bought by the Tate.\nBibliographyPaula Rego (exh. cat. by A. de Lacerda, Lisbon, Soc. N.

He studied from 1949 to 1953 under William Coldstream at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Andrews's work was, however, imbued with an instinct for capturing the mood and social behaviour of a familiar milieu: on this occasion, family holidays on the coast of his native Norfolk. In the 1960s Andrews was occupied with large party scenes that came to epitomise the decade's pleasure-seeking. Images appropriated from the media, fashion, pop music, literature and the cinema were all incorporated into paintings of people he knew. \nAnonymity of touch and a thin surface of spray-painted acrylic paint were fully exploited in the Lights series of paintings: scenes of a skyscraper, ocean liner, pier and so forth, seen from the aerial perspective of a gas balloon. Between 1976 and 1986 Andrews made 25 pictures of an estate in Scotland where he participated in deerstalking. Panoramic vistas and a sensual response to the light and forms of hills and valleys also characterised the paintings and watercolours, begun in 1983 after a trip to Australia, of Ayers Rock and the area around it; these works explored the common ground between Aboriginal sacred sites and Western religious and ethical beliefs. In 1992 Andrews moved back to London, and in 1994 completed The Thames at Low Tide (London, priv. col.). His last works continued to explore the idea of belonging and spiritual release.\n\nBibliography\n Michael Andrews (exh. cat., intro. L. Gowing; London, Hayward Gal.; Edinburgh, Fruitmarket Gal.; U.

In the early 1960s Richter was exposed to both American and British Pop art, which was just becoming known in Europe, and to the Fluxus movement. Richter consistently regarded himself simply as a painter. He began to paint enlarged copies of black-and-white photographs using only a range of greys. \nThe evident reliance on a ready-made source gave Richter's paintings an apparent objectivity that he felt was lacking in abstract art of the period. The indistinctness of the images that emerged in the course of their transformation into thick layers of oil paint helped free them of traditional associations and meaning. Richter concentrated exclusively on the process of applying paint to the surface..\nAs early as 1966 he had made paintings based on colour charts. Although these paintings, like those based on photographs, were still dependent on an existing artefact, all that was left in them was the naked physical presence of colour as the essential material of all painting.\nAll vestiges of subject-matter seem to have been abandoned by Richter in the paintings that he began to produce in 1976. Even these supposedly wholly invented paintings retained a second-hand look, as if the brushstrokes had been copied from photographic enlargements. \nThe extreme variety of Richter's work left him open to criticism, but his rejection of an artificially maintained consistency of style was a conscious conceptual act that allowed him to investigate freely the basic principles of painting.\nBibliographyK.

However, de Chirico's attitude towards tradition and the past was always ambiguous and ironic. The building fragments that emerge from the mannequins' stomachs, for example, seem vaguely classical but also suggest a child's building blocks.\n \n \n \n August 2004\n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1926", "dimensions": "Support: 1464 x 1149 mm", "reference": "N05976", "title": "The Painter\u2019s Family", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/de-chirico-the-painters-family-n05976", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05976_8.jpg", "artist": "Giorgio de Chirico", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1888\u20131978", "artistbio": "\n Giorgio de Chirico 1888-1978Italian painter, sculptor, theatrical designer and writer\nborn at Volo in Greece, of Italian parents.

The artist wrote to the compiler (17 July 1961) that 'I was first asked to make a drawing based on this poem... by John Berger - and I did several - I did the one he specifically asked for and he had another besides - then others are in Private Collections - but there is a drawing in the Whitworth Gallery, Manchester - and I have a few in my studio.\n\n'The poem is a very fine one and my interpretation seemed to impress and intrigue Berger for he later suggested I did a large painting. What you describe is wrong it is not supposed to be an old man - just man - the poet maybe - for the owl is holding a shroud which in some drawings is covered with handwriting and from this shroud the figure falls into the deep unknown.\n\n\u2018 \u201cRage Rage against the dying of the light\u201d may be in the nature of protest - but futile.

By November 1915 Bomberg had enlisted in the Royal Engineers, and his harrowing experiences at the Front brought about a profound transformation in his outlook.\nBomberg never again returned to this dogged and limiting idiom, but he did explore a radically different path during the 1920s. His disillusion with the destructive power of the machine at war led to a few years spent experimenting with ways of making his stark pre-war style more rounded and organic. \nThroughout the 1930s Bomberg's art became broader and more impassioned as he sought to convey the essence of his response to landscapes in Scotland and Spain. This work met with little approval in Britain, and during World War II his outstanding series of Bomb Store paintings did not lead to further commissions from the War Artists Committee, despite his repeated requests. His last years were darkened by the realization that his art remained overlooked and even belittled in Britain.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Hesitate is one of a group of black and white paintings made by Riley in 1964 in\nwhich the titles imply emotional tension, for example Disturbance, Chill, Loss and Pause. The shapes were drawn first using a compass, and with templates for the larger ellipses; the smaller ones were drawn freehand.\nThe shades of grey were judged by eye. Pause, 1964 (private collection) is similar in design to Hesitate, but with the ellipses forming a vertical line and the changes of tone reversed. Pause itself develops an idea in an\nearlier painting Movement in Squares, 1961 (Arts Council Collection), but with the rectangles replaced by ellipses and circles, and with the addition of the changes of tone. Riley was concerned that the painting should be seen as a whole, as\na 'field', and the individual parts not noticed. She described Pause (conversation of 11 April 1986), with its vertical fold, as associated with the human figure, and Hesitate in contrast as like a landscape. The overall size of each\npainting is crucial to the placing of the fold and to the visual effect, which depends on an awareness of the contrast between different parts at the same time.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This and two other pictures, The Great Day of His Wrath (Tate Gallery N05613) and The Plains of Heaven (Tate Gallery T01928) compose a triptych, and are the last major works Martin produced before his death. They are generally considered among\nhis most important achievements, possibly his masterpiece. The subjects are taken from The Book of Revelation. The Last Judgement illustrates the central event of the Book, and is composed from various passages in the narrative. On a throne in\nthe heavens sits God in judgement, surrounded by the four and twenty elders. The four angels have sounded their trumpets after the opening of the Seventh Seal. Below on the right the forces of evil commanded by Satan are defeated; the armies of Gog and\nMagog tumble into the bottomless pit. To the left on Mount Zion are the good, already in the 'plains of heaven' and awaiting the call to appear before the throne. The principal figures were identified in an engraved key published in 1855 by\nLeggatt, Haward and Leggatt to accompany the picture. The damned include richly dressed women, notably Herodias's daughter and the whore of Babylon, lawyers and churchmen who have sought only worldly wealth. The saved, at God's right hand, are\nanonymous figures of virtuous women and innocent children, true lovers, martyrs, philanthropists, and foreground, portraits of the famous. Among the good Martin has included a high percentage of artists and poets, as well as statesmen and philosophers.\nThese include Thomas More, Wesley, Canute, Dante, Washington, Copernicus, Newton, Watt, Chaucer, Tasso, Corneille, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Rubens, D-4rer and Wilkie. The great men are ranged in a timeless tableau; Martin reproduces their best known\nimages. Included among the contemporary detail is a railway train plunging into an abyss, its carriages marked 'London', 'Paris', and so on.Further reading:William Feaver, The Art of John Martin, Oxford 1975,\npp.188-204, reproduced p.191Terry RiggsNovember 1997 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1853", "dimensions": "Support: 1968 x 3258 mm", "reference": "T01927", "title": "The Last Judgement", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-the-last-judgement-t01927", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01927_8.jpg", "artist": "John Martin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1789\u20131854", "artistbio": "\n Martin was born near Hexham, Northumberland.

Freud spent most of his career in Paddington, London, an inner-city area whose seediness is reflected in Freud's often sombre and moody interiors and cityscapes. In the 1940s he was principally interested in drawing, especially the face. He experimented with Surrealism. He was also loosely associated with Neo-Romanticism. He established his own artistic identity, however, in meticulously executed realist works, imbued with a pervasive mood of alienation. \nTwo important paintings of 1951 established the themes and preoccupations that dominated the rest of Freud's career: Interior in Paddington (Liverpool, Walker A.G.) and Girl with a White Dog (London, Tate). Both paintings demonstrate an eagerness to establish a highly charged situation, in which the artist is free to explore formal and optical problems rather than expressive or interpretative ones. \nBy the late 1950s brushmarks became spatial as he began to describe the face and body in terms of shape and structure, and often in female nudes the brushstrokes help to suggest shape. Throughout his career Freud's palette remained distinctly muted.\nA close relationship with sitters was often important for Freud. His mother sat for an extensive series in the early 1970s after she was widowed, and his daughters Bella and Esther modelled nude, together and individually. Although the human form dominated his output, Freud also executed cityscapes, viewed from his studio window, and obsessively detailed nature studies. The 1980s and early 1990s were marked by increasingly ambitious compositions in terms of both scale and complexity.\nBibliographyJ.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This picture, presented to the National Gallery in 1847, and subsequently transferred to Tate in 1951, has for many years been among Reynolds's best known works. In the nineteenth century it was deeply admired and frequently copied, National Gallery records revealing that between its acquisition and the end of the century no fewer than 323 full-scale copies in oil were made. \n\nThe picture was not a commissioned portrait but a character study, or 'fancy picture', as the genre was known in the eighteenth century. The present title was not invented by Reynolds, but derives from an engraving of 1794, the second impression of which was inscribed 'The Age of Innocence'. Traditionally, it is has been thought that the picture was painted in 1788. However, it is very probably identifiable with a work exhibited by Reynolds at the Royal Academy in 1785, and entitled simply 'a little girl'. On 8 April 1785 The Morning Herald, previewing Reynolds's proposed exhibits for the forthcoming Royal Academy exhibition, noted: 'An Infant Girl, disposed on a grass plat in an easy attitude. The companion to it is a girl fondling a bird. These subjects are fancy studies of Sir Joshua's and do him honour'. \n\nA recent examination of the Age of Innocence by the conservation department at Tate has revealed that it was painted over another celebrated fancy picture by Reynolds titled A Strawberry Girl, of which several versions are known, including one in London's Wallace collection. X-radiographs of the present picture indicate that only the hands of the original Strawberry Girl remained unaltered by Reynolds. As Tate conservator Rica Jones has noted, it is possible that the Strawberry Girl was completed by Reynolds and then altered as a result of large paint losses, now made visible by x-ray (Rica Jones in Hackney et al. 1999, pp.60-5). This is not especially surprising since there are several contemporary accounts of pictures by Reynolds (including an unidentified study of a young girl) from which whole areas of paint became detached owing to the artist's defective technique. The picture was relined (backed with a new canvas) sometime in the early nineteenth century and conservation records at Tate, dating back to 1859, indicate that the painting has continued to suffer from extensive cracking and flaking. The identity of Reynolds's model is uncertain. According to Sir Robert Edgcumbe, a Victorian descendant of Reynolds, she was the artist's great-niece Theophila Gwatkin (1782-1844), who would have been three years old in 1785. Alternatively, it has been suggested that she was a Miss Anne Fletcher, although since she was married around 1791 this identification is clearly incorrect. Finally, it has been asserted that she was Lady Anne Spencer (1773-1865), who was the youngest daughter of the 4th Duke of Marlborough, and who had featured in Reynolds's group portrait of The Marlborough Family (Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire). Interestingly, there is a facial similarity between the girl in the present picture and Lady Anne Spencer. However, if she was Reynolds's model, the picture must have been painted in the later 1770s, rather than the mid-1780s as seems likely.\n\nFurther reading:Rica Jones, 'The Age of Innocence', in S.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is the only completed easel painting that William Morris produced. It is a portrait in medieval dress of Jane Burden, whom Morris married in April 1859. The picture has been identified in the past as Queen Guenevere, partly owing to the fact that Morris published his first volume of poetry, The Defence of Guenevere, in March 1858. However, recent research has established convincingly that the picture is intended to represent Iseult mourning Tristram's exile from the court of King Mark.\n\nIseult appears to have recently arisen from her bed, where a small greyhound lies curled up among the crumpled sheets. In Le Morte d'Arthur (c.1470), the author, Sir Thomas Malory (c.1405-71), reminds us that 'the queen had always a little brachet [bitch-hound] with her that Sir Tristram gave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never would that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh' (quoted in Banham and Harris, p.115). She stands wistfully in her small chamber, her feelings for Tristram reinforced by the sprigs of rosemary, symbolising remembrance, in her crown, and the word 'DOLOURS' (grief) written down the side of her mirror.\n\nThe rich colours, the emphasis on pattern and details such as the illuminated missal reveal where Morris's true talents lay. He was less at home with figure painting than with illumination, embroidery and woodcarving, and he struggled for months on this picture. He worked for much of the time at 17 Red Lion Square, the rooms he shared with Edward Burne-Jones. Many of the furnishings such as the Turkish rug, Persian embroidered cover and whitework hangings on the bed were probably in Morris's personal collection. The background panel is close in style to the heavy tapestries designed by Morris for Red Lion Square and the table cover is of the type taken as a model by Morris and Webb for the firm's church furnishings. \n\nIn 1874 the picture was claimed as his own by Ford Madox Brown's son Oliver. Rossetti, who had a great fondness for Jane Burden, offered him \u00a320 for it as 'an early portrait of its original, of whom I have made so many studies myself' (quoted in Parry, p.103). The picture eventually passed to Rossetti's brother, William Michael. It lay forgotten in a cupboard until Rossetti's death, when it was returned to Jane Burden.\n\nFurther reading:Joanna Banham and Jennifer Harris (eds), William Morris and the Middle Ages, exhibition catalogue, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester 1984, pp.114-6, reproduced pl.IV, in colour.Leslie Parris (ed.), The Pre-Raphaelites, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1984, reprinted 1994, pp.169-70; reproduced p.169.Linda Parry (ed.), William Morris, exhibition catalogue, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London 1996, pp.102-3, reproduced p.89, in colour.\n\nFrances FowleDecember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1858", "dimensions": "Support: 718 x 502 mm", "reference": "N04999", "title": "La Belle Iseult", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/morris-la-belle-iseult-n04999", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N04/N04999_8.jpg", "artist": "William Morris", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1834\u20131896", "artistbio": "\n English designer, writer and activist.

His childhood, spent at Cannycourt, County Kildare, was blighted by asthma from which he suffered throughout his life. With the outbreak of war in 1914, his father took the family to London and joined the Ministry of War; they divided the post-war years between London and Ireland. Bacon repeatedly ran away from his school in Cheltenham (1924-6). After his authoritarian father, repelled by his burgeoning homosexuality, threw him out of the family home for wearing his mother\u2019s clothes, Bacon arrived in London in 1926 with little schooling but with a weekly allowance of \u00a33 from his mother. \n\u00a0\nIn 1927 Bacon travelled to Berlin (frequenting the city\u2019s homosexual night-clubs) and Paris. He was impressed by Picasso\u2019s 1927 exhibition (Galerie Paul Rosenberg) and began to draw and paint while attending the free Academies. Returning to London in the following year, he established himself (and his childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot) at Queensbury Mews West, South Kensington. He worked as a furniture and interior designer in the modernist style of Eileen Gray and exhibited his designs there in 1929. These were featured in the Studio1 before he shared a second studio show with the painters Jean Shepeard and Roy de Maistre (Nov. 1930). An early patron was the businessman, Eric Hall, who would became Bacon\u2019s lover and supporter (c.1934- c.1950). As well as designing, Bacon continued to paint with de Maistre as an important influence and practical guide on matters of technique. The results showed the impact of Jean Lur\u00e7at and Picasso, and a Crucifixion shown at the Mayor Gallery in 1933 was juxtaposed with a Picasso in Herbert Read\u2019s Art Now and bought by the collector Sir Michael Sadler. In the following year, the painter organised his first solo exhibition in the basement of a friend\u2019s house (Sunderland House, Curzon Street) renamed \u2018Transition Gallery\u2019 for the purpose, but it was not well received and he responded by destroying the paintings. His works were rejected by Read for the International Surrealist Exhibition (1936), but Bacon and de Maistre helped Hall to organise Young British Painters (Agnew and Sons, Jan. 1937), which included Graham Sutherland, Victor Pasmore and others.\n\u00a0\nWith the coming of war in 1939, Bacon was exempt from military service and released by the ARP on account of his asthma. He spent 1941 painting in Hampshire, before returning to London where he met Lucian Freud and was close to Sutherland. From these years emerged the works which he later considered as the beginning of his career, pre-eminently the partial bodies of Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, 1944 (Tate Gallery N06171) which was first shown at the Lefevre Gallery (April 1945) to unease and acclaim alike. Bacon became central to an artistic milieu in post-war Soho, which included Lucian Freud, Michael Andrews, the photographer John Deakin, Henrietta Moraes, Isabel Rawsthorne and others. On Sutherland\u2019s recommendation Erica Brausen secured the painter\u2019s contract with the Hanover Gallery and sold Painting 1946 to the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1948. Bacon gambled away the results at Monte Carlo and, as homosexuality remained illegal, his lifestyle in London and France was tinged with the illicit.\n\u00a0\nThe early 1950s saw a period of success and rootlessness following the death of Jessie Lightfoot. Bacon\u2019s first post-war solo exhibition included the first of many works inspired by Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Pope Innocent X, 1650 (Galleria Doria Pamphili, Rome) and showed his use of characteristic enclosing frameworks (Hanover Gallery, December 1951 \u2013 February 1952); it was followed by his New York debut (Durlacher Gallery, October 1953). The paintings of Popes, which established his reputation, alternated with those of contemporary figures in suits who were similarly entrapped; however, following a trip to Egypt and South Africa (1950) a lighter tonality emerged in paintings of sphinxes and of animals. During this period, Peter Lacey became Bacon\u2019s lover and inspired homoerotic images of wrestlers derived from Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s photographs in Animal Locomotion (Philadelphia 1887), Animals in Motion (London 1899) and The Human Figure in Motion (London 1901); the photographs became a habitual source, just as the theme of sexual encounter persisted. In Italy in 1954, Bacon avoided seeing Velazquez\u2019s Pope Innocent X in Rome and his own paintings at the Venice Biennale, where he shared the British pavilion with Ben Nicholson and Freud. Two years later, he visited Lacey in Tangiers, and met the American writers William Burroughs and Paul Bowles, and the painter Ahmed Yacoubi; Bacon subsequently returned regularly until Lacey\u2019s death in 1962. \n\u00a0\nThe exhibition of paintings after Van Gogh (Hanover Gallery, 1957) marked the sudden departure from the preceding monochromatic works towards heightened colour. Despite their success, in the following year the painter transferred dealer to Marlborough Fine Art; they paid off his growing gambling debts, mounted larger exhibitions and ensured that he destroyed fewer canvases. In 1961, Bacon settled in Reece Mews, South Kensington, where he remained for the rest of his life, and in the following year the Tate Gallery organised a major touring retrospective which saw the resumption of his use of the triptych which would become his characteristic format. At that time he recorded the first of the interviews with the critic David Sylvester which would constitute the canonical text on his own work.\n\u00a0\nIn 1963-4, Bacon\u2019s international reputation was confirmed with his retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1963) and by the publication of Ronald Alley\u2019s catalogue raison\u00e9e. He refused the Carnegie Institute Award (1967) and donated the Rubens Prize towards the restorations following the flood of Florence. On the eve of Bacon\u2019s large retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris (1971), his long-time lover George Dyer committed suicide and this event left haunting echoes in ensuing paintings. However in 1974, John Edwards became the painter\u2019s companion and model. \n\u00a0\nIn the 1970s Bacon travelled regularly to New York and Paris, where he bought a pied-\u00e0-terre, and publications helped to establish the popular image of his work as a reflection of the anxiety of the modern condition. International exhibitions became more wide-ranging: Marseilles (1976), Mexico and Caracas (1977), Madrid and Barcelona (1978), Tokyo (1983). They reinforced the perception of Bacon as the greatest British painter since J.M.W. Turner. His works from this period were dominated by the triptych, but the figures grew calmer and were set against flat expanses of colour. In isolated images without a human presence, an animal power was retained in segments of dune and waste land. The exhibitions culminated in a second Tate retrospective (1985, travelling to Stuttgart and Berlin), and shows in Moscow (1988) - a sign of post-Communist liberalism - and Washington (1989). On a visit to Madrid in 1992, Bacon was hospitalised with pneumonia exacerbated by asthma and died on 28 April.\n\u00a0\nBibliography:\nRonald Alley and John Rothenstein, Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 and Documentation, London 1964\nJohn Russell, Francis Bacon, London, Paris and Berlin 1971, 2nd ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This picture celebrates the British defence of Jersey against French invasion in 1781 and also pays tribute to a young Major, Francis Peirson, who lost his life in the process. Originally a part of France, the island of Jersey had been in the possession of the English since 1066. On the night of 5-6 January 1781 a small army of French soldiers landed on the island and marched on the capital, St Helier. They captured the Governor, Moses Corbet, and forced him to sign a document of surrender. However, the British garrison and the Jersey militia launched a counter-attack, led by Major Peirson, during the course of which Peirson was killed by a French sniper. Almost immediately, Peirson's black servant, Pompey, turned on the sniper and shot him dead. A battle ensued in Royal Square and the French were defeated.\n\nAt a time when defeat in the American colonies was imminent, news of the British victory in Jersey was greeted with alacrity in England. John Boydell, a successful engraver and printseller, immediately commissioned this picture from Copley, who had already made his reputation with The Collapse of the Earl of Chatham in the House of Lords (1779-81, Tate N00100).\n\nThe theme of the modern noble hero expiring at the scene of battle was established by Benjamin West (1738-1820), who, like Copley, was American by birth. Copley increased the drama of the event by making the moment of Peirson's death coincide with the British victory over the French, rather than earlier in the battle. The picture is full of movement and colour, but is also carefully orchestrated. Peirson's body in the centre of the picture offers a splash of white against the red of the soldiers' jackets, and appears to topple forward out of the painting. The group of men who support him, like figures in a Deposition, are crowned by the Union Jack, a symbol of Britain's victory. To their left, the black servant, Pompey, has just shot the French sniper in the background. To the right of the picture, a terrified family (modelled on Copley's own wife, family nurse and children), attempt to flee from the scene. Many of the officers in the painting are said to be accurate portraits and Pompey was modelled by the black servant of the auctioneer James Christie. The setting for the picture is also carefully depicted, looking towards Royal Square along what is now Peirson Place, with the statue of George II in the background.\n\nWhen the picture was first exhibited publicly in May 1784, crowds of people came to see it and, according to one critic, 'the chorus of praise reached all the way to Buckingham Palace' (quoted in Wilson, p.35).\n\nFurther reading:Jules David Prown, J.S.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Ota\u00efti is a striking example of Francis Picabia\u2019s \u2018transparencies\u2019, a major body of works the artist made between c.1928 and c.1931. Leading from two figurative series Picabia made during the mid-late 1920s \u2013 the Espagnoles, portraying archetypal Spanish women, and the Monsters which traced multi-eyed creatures in heavy black outline \u2013 the transparencies moved dramatically away from the iconoclasm of the artist\u2019s Dada period and his earlier mechanomorphic works. In the dream-like tableaux of the transparencies, Picabia referenced imagery ranging from ancient Rome to the Renaissance, often juxtaposing the sacred with the profane. These works draw on mythology, religion, the natural world and conventional ideals of beauty, and in their blending of the unexpected, seen in Ota\u00efti\u2019s bizarre assortment of images and warped scale, they touch on a distinctly surreal sensibility. \n\nThe term \u2018transparency\u2019 has a special reference here to photographic transparencies, reflecting the artist\u2019s interest in photography and film and his preoccupation with notions of optics. In the illusionary quality and optical ambiguity of many of the transparencies Picabia plays on innovations in cinematographic techniques he had explored in 1924 in the film Entr\u2019acte. The collaborative project with director Ren\u00e9 Clair and composer Eric Satie was produced as a \u2018cinematographic intermission\u2019 for Picabia and Satie\u2019s ballet Rel\u00e2che, and included sequences of image overlay. Picabia\u2019s fascination with film may also be traced back to an earlier date. Writing in 1934, Gertrude Stein recalled Picabia\u2019s description of his early introduction to photography: \n\n\n\nPicabia, when he was a young boy, was always with his grandfather ... who was doing experiments with coloured photography at that time ... So they photographed all day and developed all night, and this early experience, so Picabia believes ... has had a great deal to do with the development of modern painting. Picabia got from the constant contact with photography ... something which did give him the idea of transparence and four dimensional painting, and this through him certainly has a great deal to do with everything. Even now in his later painting and his drawing he has achieved a transparence which is peculiarly a thing which has nothing to do with the surface seen. \n\n(Stein quoted in Wilson 1989, p.13.) \n\n\nIndeed, there is an ethereal quality to the transparencies which seems to evoke something beyond the physical surface of the artwork. This is not only created by the interweaving of linear imagery through which the viewer must visually traverse the compositions, but also Picabia\u2019s unusual layering of paint with other media. In Ota\u00efti he has achieved a sub-aquatic depth to the surface through the dual application of pigment with layers of varnish. The resulting antique-like patina has a watery, translucent appearance which appears to shift between suggestions of the visible and invisible. \n\nPicabia painted Ota\u00efti during the first half of 1930 at the Ch\u00e2teau du Mai, his house in Cannes in the south of France. It was in Cannes that the work was first exhibited in August of that year, at the Galerie Alexandre III: the painting can be seen in an installation photograph which shows the work hanging alongside other transparencies, all equally large in scale. The imposing canvas of Ota\u00efti is dominated by the figure of a naked, kneeling woman with upraised arms. An over-sized hand \u2013 perhaps a reference to Michaelangelo\u2019s image of the hand of God from the Sistine Chapel in Rome \u2013 points towards her from the right. A miniature winged horse floats above her, bringing to mind Pegasus, the legendary flying horse of Greek mythology. Born from the blood of the Gorgon Medusa, Pegasus gave his name to a constellation of stars, and perhaps more pertinent to this work, is frequently associated with the arts, due to his creation of a sacred spring dedicated to the Muses. However, despite this possible allusion to Greek myth, the painting offers no clear narrative and like so many of the transparencies it remains enigmatic. As one commentator has noted: \n\n\n\nPicabia described the transparencies as spaces where he might express for himself \u2018the resemblance of my interior desires\u2019, as paintings \u2018where all my instincts may have a free course\u2019. But insofar as is known, he shared not one word of more specific explanation about his intentions, visual sources or titles with anyone, not even close friends and family. Accordingly, never was he more successful in painting for himself than in these works \u2013 transparent perhaps in form but veiled in content. (Camfield 1979, pp.233-4)\n\n\nIt is clear that in the project of the transparencies Picabia was intentionally reworking existing imagery. He is known to have had a significant collection of books and journals, including many art historical tomes, and it is likely that many of his images were drawn from these. In recent years art historians have gone far in identifying many of his sources. However, numerous remain unknown and further research is being undertaken to determine the basis for the female nude in Ota\u00efti. Her highly feminised, yet athletic body, red lips and full breasts suggest she is a contemporary woman. Picabia had begun to incorporate glamorised visions of modern woman into his work during the 1920s, and the features of Ota\u00efti\u2019s central character correlate to the fashionable woman\u2019s head Picabia painted over the portrait of The Handsome Pork-Butcher c.1924-6/c.1929-35 (T07108). Her physique also anticipates the kitsch nudes Picabia painted during the 1940s, figures which the artists lifted wholesale from entertainment journals and semi-pornographic magazines such as Paris Plaisirs and Paris Sex Appeal. \n\nIn addition to the central female figure, Picabia includes in Ota\u00efti a collection of strangely juxtaposed motifs which form part of the wide vocabulary of signs he used throughout the transparencies. An identical double mask can be found located in exactly the same position on the canvas in Luscunia, c.1929, while an expanded version of the ram\u2019s head is laid over the centre of the composition of Medea, c.1929. Other elements, such as hands, foliage, musical instruments and snake-like forms, all found in Ota\u00efti, also feature regularly in various guises in other works from the transparency period. \n\nThroughout his career, Picabia frequently painted the title of his works on the front of his canvases, and here the title can be seen at the top left-hand corner. This has often been thought to read TA\u00cfTI. However, examination by Tate conservators has confirmed that the inscription reads OTA\u00cfTI, and this title is corroborated by the earliest known written documentation of the painting in a catalogue of an exhibition of Picabia\u2019s work held at the Galerie Georges Bernheim, Paris in 1931. In keeping with the specificity of his sources for the iconography of the transparencies, it is known that Picabia mined his titles from particular volumes (several, for example, are taken from a book on butterflies in Picabia\u2019s possession, Paul Girod\u2019s Atlas de poche des papillons de France, Suisse et Belgique, Paris 1912). However, like the source for the central figure, it is not yet known where Picabia first came across \u2018Ota\u00efti\u2019 (an archaic French derivation of the island name Tahiti), nor what prompted him to use it for this particular painting. \n\n\nFurther reading\nMaria Luisa Borras, Picabia, London 1985.\nWilliam Camfield, Francis Picabia: His Art, Life and Times, Princeton, New Jersey 1979.\nSarah Wilson, Francis Picabia: Accommodations of Desire, New York 1989.\n\n\nLucy Askew\nDecember 2005\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint and resin on canvas", "date": "1930", "dimensions": "Support: 1940 x 1303 mm", "reference": "T11982", "title": "Ota\u00efti", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picabia-otaiti-t11982", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T11/T11982_8.jpg", "artist": "Francis Picabia", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1879\u20131953", "artistbio": "\n French painter and writer.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The picture illustrates the following lines from part IV of Tennyson's 'The Lady of Shalott':\n\n\nAnd down the river's dim expanse\nLike some bold seer in a trance,\nSeeing all his own mischance -\nWith glassy countenance\nDid she look to Camelot.\nAnd at the closing of the day\nShe loosed the chain, and down she lay;\nThe broad stream bore her far away,\nThe Lady of Shalott.\n\n\nTennyson's poem, first published in 1832, tells of a woman who suffers under an undisclosed curse. She lives isolated in a tower on an island called Shalott, on a river which flows down from King Arthur's castle at Camelot. Not daring to look upon reality, she is allowed to see the outside world only through its reflection in a mirror. One day she glimpses the reflected image of the handsome knight Lancelot, and cannot resist looking at him directly. The mirror cracks from side to side, and she feels the curse come upon her. The punishment that follows results in her drifting in her boat downstream to Camelot 'singing her last song', but dying before she reaches there. Waterhouse shows her letting go the boat's chain, while staring at a crucifix placed in front of three guttering candles. Tennyson was a popular subject for artists of this period, particularly the\u00a0Pre-Raphaelites\n\n. Waterhouse's biographer Anthony Hobson relates that the artist owned a copy of Tennyson's collected works, and covered every blank page with\u00a0pencil\n\n\u00a0sketches for paintings\n\n.\n\nThe\u00a0landscape\n\n setting is highly naturalistic; the painting was made during Waterhouse's brief period of\u00a0plein-air\n\n painting. The setting is not identified, although the Waterhouses frequently visited Somerset and Devon. The model is traditionally said to be the artist's wife. Waterhouse's sketchbook contains numerous pencil studies for this and the painting of the same title made six years later (1894, Leeds City Art Gallery). This second work shows the Lady at the moment she looks out of the window and the curse is fulfilled. Waterhouse also made sketches of the final scenes in which the boat bearing the Lady floats into Camelot.\n\nThe Lady of Shalott\u00a0is one of the original paintings from the gift of Sir Henry Tate.\n\nFurther reading:\nAnthony Hobson,\u00a0The Art and Life of J W Waterhouse RA 1849-1917, London 1980, pp.pp.51-6, 183, reproduced pp.54-5 in colour\nAnthony Hobson,\u00a0J W Waterhouse, Oxford 1989, pp.40-1, 53, 77, 109, reproduced p.42 in colour\n\nTerry Riggs\nFebruary 1998\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1888", "dimensions": "Support: 1530 x 2000 mm", "reference": "N01543", "title": "The Lady of Shalott", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-lady-of-shalott-n01543", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01543_8.jpg", "artist": "John William Waterhouse", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1849\u20131917", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

From 1877 to the 1880s he regularly travelled abroad, particularly to Italy. \nWaterhouse created a distinctive type of female beauty which dominates his work, and he was fascinated by myths of the enchantress. His favourite device was to create psychological tension between a single figure and a group.\nWaterhouse is the best known of the artists who from the 1880s revived the literary themes popularised by the Pre-Raphaelites, though he was not Pre-Raphaelite in technique. His fondness for backgrounds conceived as blocks of colour and tone, as well as the broad, chunky brushwork of his draperies and accessories, ultimately derive from such European prototypes as Jules Bastien-Lepage. This style was transmitted to Waterhouse through his acquaintance with members of the Newlyn school.\nWaterhouse drew all the themes of his later work from literature and Greek mythology. The style he had evolved remained unchanged, although after 1900 his handling became slightly looser and his colour lighter and brighter.\nFrom the 1890s Waterhouse annually exhibited one multi-figured painting at the Royal Academy and single-figure paintings at the Academy or the New Gallery. He was elected ARA in 1885 and RA in 1895. Waterhouse's works were well received until the early 20th century when his style had become outdated. \nBibliographyVictorian Olympians (exh. cat., ed. R.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The scene depicted is from Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act IV, Scene vii, in which Ophelia, driven out of her mind when her father is murdered by her lover Hamlet, drowns herself in a stream:\n\n\nThere, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds\nClambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;\nWhich time she chanted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\nOr like a creature native and indued\nUnto that element; but long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\n\n\nShakespeare was a favourite source for Victorian painters, and the tragic-romantic figure of Ophelia from Hamlet was an especially popular subject, featuring regularly in Royal Academy exhibitions. Arthur Hughes exhibited his version of her death scene in the same year as this picture was shown (Manchester City Art Gallery).\nMillais began the background in July 1851, at Ewell, Surrey. In accordance with the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he painted with close observation of nature. Millais quickly found, however, that such intense study was not without problems, and was moved to remark in a letter to Mrs Thomas Combe,\n\n\nMy martyrdom is more trying than any I have hitherto experienced. The flies of Surrey are more muscular, and have a still greater propensity for probing human flesh ... I am threatened with a notice to appear before a magistrate for trespassing in a field and destroying the hay ... am also in danger of being blown by the wind into the water, and becoming intimate with the feelings of Ophelia when that Lady sank to muddy death, together with the (less likely) total disappearance, through the voracity of the flies ... Certainly the painting of a picture under such circumstances would be a greater punishment to a murderer than hanging.\n(J.G. Millais I, pp.119-20)\n\n\nThe figure of Ophelia was added afterwards. The model, Elizabeth Siddal, a favourite of the Pre-Raphaelites who later married Rossetti, was required to pose over a four month period in a bath full of water kept warm by lamps underneath. The lamps went out on one occasion, causing her to catch a severe cold. Her father threatened the artist with legal action until he agreed to pay the doctor's bills.\n\nThe plants, most of which have symbolic significance, were depicted with painstaking botanical detail. The roses near Ophelia's cheek and dress, and the field rose on the bank, may allude to her brother Laertes calling her 'rose of May'. The willow, nettle and daisy are associated with forsaken love, pain, and innocence. Pansies refer to love in vain. Violets, which Ophelia wears in a chain around her neck, stand for faithfulness, chastity or death of the young, any of which meanings could apply here. The poppy signifies death. Forget-me-nots float in the water. Millais wrote to Thomas Combe in March 1852: 'Today I have purchased a really splendid lady's ancient dress - all flowered over in silver embroidery - and I am going to paint it for \"Ophelia\". You may imagine it is something rather good when I tell you it cost me, old and dirty as it is, four pounds' (J.G. Millais I, p.162).\n\nOphelia was part of the original Henry Tate gift to the Tate Gallery.\n\nFurther reading:\nJohn Guille Millais, The Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais, 1899, I, pp.116-20, 123, 129-131, 144-7, 151, 162-3\nLeslie Parris (ed.), The Pre-Raphaelites, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1984, reprinted 1994, pp.96-8, reproduced in colour\n\nTerry Riggs\nFebruary 1998\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1851\u20132", "dimensions": "Support: 762 x 1118 mm", "reference": "N01506", "title": "Ophelia", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-ophelia-n01506", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01506_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir John Everett Millais, Bt", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1829\u20131896", "artistbio": "\n Millais was born in Southampton, the son of John William Millais, a wealthy gentleman from an old Jersey\nfamily. His mother's family were prosperous saddlers. Considered a child prodigy, he came to London in 1838.

In 1840 he was admitted to the Royal\nAcademy Schools as their youngest ever student, winning a silver medal in 1843 for drawing from the antique, and a gold medal in 1847 for his painting The Tribe of Benjamin Seizing the Daughters of Shiloh. He first exhibited at the Royal\nAcademy in 1846, with Pizarro Seizing the Inca of Peru (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). At the Royal Academy he became friendly with fellow student William Holman Hunt, and contributed with Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti to the\nCyclographic Society. In 1848 the three helped form the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His first Pre-Raphaelite painting was Isabella (1848-9, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849. His entry for the\nfollowing year, Christ in the House of His Parents ('The Carpenter's Shop') (1849-50, Tate Gallery N03584), was received unfavourably. In 1855 he married Effie Chalmers, Ruskin's former wife, with\nwhom he had fallen in love while he was holidaying with the Ruskins in Scotland. The couple settled in Perth, where he painted Autumn Leaves (1855-6, City of Manchester Art Galleries). Between 1855 and 1864 Millais made illustrations for\nnumerous publications, including the Moxon edition of Tennyson's poems (1857), the magazine Once a Week (1859 onwards) and several novels by Trollope. He moved back to London in 1861, where he achieved popular success as a painter of child\nsubjects such as Bubbles (1886, A. &amp; F.

In 1922 moved to Paris, where his friendship with Breton and Eluard led to active participation in the Surrealist movement. His discovery of the technique of frottage (rubbing) in 1925 provided him\nwith a means of evoking hallucinatory visions. Collage novels and illustrations, including La Femme 100 T\u00eates 1929 and Une Semaine de Bont\u00e9 1934. Made his first sculpture in 1934. Went to the USA as a refugee in 1941, living first\nin or near New York, then in Sedona, Arizona; from 1950 again lived mainly in France. Awarded the main painting prize at the 1954 Venice Biennale.

The Futurist Exhibition of March 1912, held at the Sackville Gallery, London, proved decisive for his development. \nFuturism had by now become a catchword in London for anything new and outrageous, and the British avant-garde grew resentful of its influence. Nevinson continued to make Futurist paintings of machine-age London, celebrating the dynamism of the underground Tube trains, the traffic in the Strand, and a Bank Holiday crowd on Hampstead Heath. The advent of World War I changed his mind. Having gone to France with the Red Cross and been invalided home soon afterwards, he announced that he would be using \u2018Futurist technique' to express the reality of war in his new work. In subsequent paintings Nevinson confirmed that he saw the Great War essentially as a tragic event. Bleak, outspoken and often angry, his paintings of 1915\u201316 are among the masterpieces of his career, bravely opposing the prevailing jingoistic tendency. By 1919 he had given up Futurism. Retreating instead to a more traditional vision, he painted lively interpretations of New York, which fuse a lingering love of Futurist angularity with a new respect for naturalistic observation. Nevinson was at his best when dealing with the dynamism and vertiginous scale of big-city life. In later years he concentrated more on pastoral scenes and flower pieces, where a gentler mood prevailed.\nBibliographyP. G. Konody: Modern War Paintings by C. R. W. Nevinson (London, 1917)O.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This apocalyptic painting was produced by Winifred Knights as a competition entry for the final of the 1920 Prix de Rome scholarship in Decorative Painting. From an initial selection of seventeen young artists, Knights was chosen to go forward to the final round, along with Leon Underwood (1890-1975), James Wilkie and Arthur Outlaw, all of whom were also students at the Slade School of Art in London, where Knights studied intermittently between October 1915 and July 1920. The theme of 'The Deluge' was designated for the final prize, with eight weeks allowed for the submission of 'a painting in oil or tempera and a cartoon' (quoted in Alan Powers, 'Decorative Painting in the early Twentieth Century - a Context for Winifred Knights, in Winifred Knights 1899-1947, p.17). The size of the painting, 5ft by 6ft, was also set in advance by the judges. Knights began working on the canvas on 5 July 1920. Despite suffering from tonsillitis and eye problems over the summer, and submitting her painting partly unfinished, she won the award, taking up the three-year scholarship at the British School at Rome in November.\n\nWhile Knights initially conceived the Biblical Flood scene with a frieze of figures and animals calmly entering Noah's ark in the foreground and placid, horizontal tracts of landscape in the distance, the final design was altogether more dramatic. Frenzied figures flee from the engulfing waters towards high ground, while the ark, windowless and silent, glides away in the distance. Sharp diagonals create a sense of dynamic movement across the canvas reminiscent of the Vorticist experiments of David Bomberg (1890-1957) and Edward Wadsworth (1889-1949) before the First World War (1914-18). While the other finalists depicted classical, semi-nude figures (see Winifred Knights 1899-1947, p.16), Knights worked in a more clearly modernist idiom, preferring stylised, clothed figures and crisply defined shadows. Viewers were struck by the contemporary rendering of the subject. When the painting was displayed in an exhibition of the competition entries at London's Royal Academy in February 1921, one commentator for The Daily Graphic described how 'the ark suggests the modern concrete buildings, and the figures are those of present-day men and women. Critics declare the painter a genius' (The Daily Graphic, 8 February, quoted in Judith Collins, 'Winifred Knights 1899-1947', in Winifred Knights 1899-1947, p.9).\n\nAmong the 'present-day men and women' was Knights herself, who appears as the woman at centre right in the foreground. Her mother also modelled for the woman carrying a baby, while Knights's friend, the artist Arnold Mason (1885-1963), posed for the male figure beside her and the man running up the hill. Placing herself in the landscape was a practical solution by which Knights could save time and money, although it may have had wider significance. Knights had been deeply affected by witnessing the detonation of a TNT plant at Silvertown, East Ham on 19 January 1917. It was the largest explosion on British soil during the First World War, with 600 homes flattened and the loss of 73 lives. At the top of a tram car nearby, Knights viewed the scene of devastation first-hand, and her intense shock led her to postpone her studies at the Slade for a year to recuperate with relatives on a farm in Lineholt, Worcestershire. The sense of panic in The Deluge may have reflected this traumatic experience; certainly the scene of terrified people fleeing imminent danger would have had a wider resonance in the aftermath of the war.\n\nKnights continued to work on Biblical and religious subjects for the rest of her career, drawing inspiration particularly from Italian quattrocento painting which she discovered during her studies in Rome. Like Stanley Spencer (1891-1959), she was one of a number of British artists who participated in a revival of religious imagery in the 1920s. \n\nFurther Reading:Winifred Knights 1899-1947, exhibition catalogue, The British School at Rome, Rome 1995, reproduced p.27 in colourSam Smiles and Stephanie Pratt, Two-Way Traffic: British and Italian Art 1880-1980, exhibition catalogue, Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter 1996, pp.10-15\n\nJacky KleinSeptember 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1920", "dimensions": "Support: 1529 x 1835 mm", "reference": "T05532", "title": "The Deluge", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/knights-the-deluge-t05532", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05532_8.jpg", "artist": "Winifred Knights", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1899\u20131947", "artistbio": "\n Winifred Margaret KNIGHTS 1899\u20131947\n\nDecorative painter.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is one of a series of several Water Paintings Hume made in 1999. The Water Paintings are silhouettes of women outlined against a monochrome background. The women's standing bodies have been drawn in another colour by painting over the background. Tate's Water Painting is green with white outlines. The drawn figures are large, their heads and torsos filling the canvas, and are layered over one another. They appear as a series of overlapping lines, resulting in fragments of faces, shoulders, breasts, arms and hands not clearly belonging to any one distinct entity. The women range in size, creating a sense of perspective and movement, which could be read as a series of freeze-frame images of a body moving towards the viewer. Varying hairstyles are the only indication of difference between women whose stylised bodies seem identical, the representation of an idealised form. Hume usually traces his images from photographs (found in magazines and books or taken himself) onto a sheet of acetate and projects the outline onto his hard painting surface. The Water Paintings were made from photographs, followed by drawings, of Hume's wife Georgie and a friend, Zoe. He then fills the outlined areas with paint in sections of monotone colour. He uses household gloss paint for its reflective qualities and has commented that 'the high-gloss finish \u2026 starts to have a life of its own because it reflects the environment the paintings are shown in \u2026 they make you think about light and about where the paintings begin and end' (quoted in 'Brilliant', p.45). Hume is one of the group of young British artists whose careers were launched by the seminal group show Freeze, organised and curated by artist Damien Hirst (born 1965) in London's Docklands in 1988. A characteristic of the work of artists in this exhibition was the appropriation of everyday objects and subjects. Hume's contribution was three large canvases covered in mint-white household gloss paint titled Mint Green Doors I-III 1988 (Saatchi Collection, London). Soon after this he abandoned canvas and began painting on MDF board and Formica panels, creating obsessively smooth surfaces and developing the theme of doors. These mainly monochrome and two-colour paintings are literal representations of double swing doors, often with round porthole-style windows, made using the type of paint which is generally used to coat the original doors. Such individual titles as Incubus 1991 (Tate T07184) confer wider associations. In the early to mid 1990s Hume painted such iconic subjects as the Christian Madonna 1993 (private collection, London) as well as such everyday objects as flowers, birds, children's toys and feet or hands. He also made portraits of artists and celebrities, from which he later derived his portfolio of prints, Portraits 1998 (Tate P78195-204). These paintings are decorative, simplified and abstracted representations. Their vivid colours and cartoon lines are reminiscent of the late prints of French artist Henri Matisse (1869-1954). \n\nHume has likened his shiny, skin-like painted surfaces to makeup painted over flesh ('Brilliant', p.45). This suggests an interest in the difference between the surface and what it covers or represents. The Water Paintings represent the icon 'woman' as a multiple and vertically moving figure, no longer the still and horizontally positioned object traditional to painting. The progressive movement of the women's faces and upper bodies towards the viewer make them active rather than passive subjects, a series of watery beings in rippling, fluid lines and shiny surfaces. With their reflective sheen, the Water Paintings provide a mirrored surface in which the viewer may see him or herself within the outlines of large female bodies. Historically associated with the female and the unconscious, water also evokes the elemental and spiritual. Hume has stated, 'all my paintings are religious' (quoted in Lindsay Baker, 'The Beauty Bomber', Guardian Weekend, 2 May 1998, p.43).\n\nFurther reading:'Brilliant' New Art from London, exhibition catalogue, Walker Arts Centre, Minneapolis 1995, pp.42-5Gary Hume, exhibition catalogue, British Pavilion, XLVIII Venice Biennale, British Council 1999, reproduced (colour) p.31 and (detail) front and back coversGary Hume, exhibition catalogue, Fundaci\u00f3 \"la Caixa\", Barcelona 2000, pp.90-5 and 124\n\nElizabeth ManchesterMay 2002\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Household paint on aluminium panel", "date": "1999", "dimensions": "Support: 3050 x 2440 x 21 mm", "reference": "T07618", "title": "Water Painting", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hume-water-painting-t07618", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07618_8.jpg", "artist": "Gary Hume", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1962", "artistbio": "\n English painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Hume emerged as one of the leading figures of the group of young artists working in London in the 1990s. His glossy, popular imagery captured and defined a zeitgeist, at a time when the art scene was becoming increasingly professionalised and implicated with the popular media. After graduating from Goldsmiths College, London, in 1988, he achieved early success with paintings based on hospital doors, rendered with gloss on panel and displayed in groups of four. These works had an international appeal. Despite their success, Hume abandoned the formal manoeuvering of the door series in the early 1990s, in favour of a simple, flatly coloured representational style drawing on a broad pool of popular and prosaic subject-matter. Hume's own admission of the superficial role of such subject-matter points to the role of figurative imagery as a stimulant to his primary preoccupations of structure, surface and colour. The concentration on both literal and metaphoric surface was augmented by the change from panel to aluminium support effected in the mid 1990s, at which point he began to focus, in his own words, on \u2018flora, fauna and portraiture'. While paintings such as the disarmingly touching portrait of Francis Bacon, Francis (1997; priv. col., see 1999\u20132000 exh. cat.), show an indebtedness to pop-art overstatement, othersdemonstrate an affinity with the more introverted painting of Patrick Caulfield.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In the 1820s Burney executed four large water-colour paintings satirising contemporary\nmusical and social life: The Waltz (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), The Elegant Establishment for Young Ladies (Victoria and Albert Museum), Amateurs of Tye-Wig Music (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut)\nand The Glee Club; or, The Triumph of Music (Yale Center for British Art). Burney may have intended to publish prints of the paintings and to sell both originals and prints, in the manner of Hogarth's 'Progresses'. There was a substantial\nmarket for satirical prints during this period. The four pictures were, however, never published. This is a version of the third-named painting, the only one, apparently, which Burney reworked as an oil painting. Its theme is the battle between\n'modern' and 'traditional' taste in the music world. The modern is represented by references to Beethoven, Mozart and others in the foreground, while traditional taste is epitomised by Handel, whose bust looks down upon a group of musicians,\nappropriately dressed, who are playing (discordantly) music by his great contemporary Arcangelo Corelli. The concert takes place in a room whose decorations are predominantly Gothick in style, a further indication of the revival of ancient tastes.\nBurney includes many apparent and traditional amusing details such as the howling dog, noisy children, striking clocks, a careless servant, and a sneezing, coughing, snoring and throat-clearing audience. Burney's picture is full of clever and subtle\nallusions to the battle between the Ancients and Moderns at a time when a revival of interest in the work of old composers such as Handel was beginning to challenge the accepted supremacy of contemporaries such as Beethoven. Burney came from a family\nprominent in the arts. His uncle, Dr Charles Burney, was a noted musicologist who was at the centre of a lively debate about the respective merits of 'old' and 'new' music, and his writings undoubtedly provided Edward with much of the inspiration\nfor this picture. An intense rivalry existed between Dr Burney and Sir John Hawkins, a traditionalist, and Hawkins was inevitably the target of satirisation by Burney's many friends. Dr Burney wrote a long satiric poem about Hawkins in 1777, entitled\nThe Trial of Midas the Second, naming numerous musicians associated with Hawkins and Burney.

His uncle was the musicologist Dr Charles Burney and his\ncousin the writer Fanny Burney. Edward Burney enrolled in the Royal Academy School in 1776, staying until sometime in the early 1780s. He became acquainted with James Barry and other less prominent artists, and was soon encouraged in his career by the\nAcademy President, Joshua Reynolds. A virtuoso draughtsman, Burney devoted the greater part of his career to producing book illustrations, although he also painted some portraits. He rarely exhibited at the Royal Academy, and never married. His\nperformances on the violin as part of amateur private concerts receive occasional mention in contemporary journals. Burney possessed a fine comic sense and his use of wit and irony, combined with his somewhat rococo drawing style, connects him with\nWilliam Hogarth. His most important and interesting work is a set of four large watercolours from the 1820s in which he satirises contemporary musical and social life. Two of these are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and two are in the Yale\nCenter for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This complex and multi-coloured composition was painted by Agar in 1933-4, while she was living at 47 Bramham Gardens, Earls Court, London. Although not yet part of the Surrealist movement she was aware of ideas being promulgated by the group. Her idiosyncratic juxtaposition of ideas and images, which had first emerged in Three Symbols (Tate T00707), was developed further in The Autobiography of an Embryo.\n\nThe horizontal painting is divided into four sections with a decorative border running along the top and bottom of the canvas. The composition is reminiscent of the arrangement of a classical wall painting, with winged putti on top of the dividing columns. A Greco-Roman influence is also evident in the abstract shapes and patterns. Draped figures, which recall antiques statues, and the geometric patterns similarly echo the decoration on ancient Greek vessels. \n\nSuch an array of symbols evokes a cultural heritage. In the second section the head of a African woman resembles African sculptures and a head seen in profile refers to Italian Renaissance portraiture. More specifically, the squat figure who appears twice in the first two sections, represents Ubu, a character in the French play of 1896 by Alfred Jarry. These quotations are combined with modern elements, such as the brick wall in the second section and the graffitti-like head on the far right. \n\nOrganic and biological forms run through the composition. Agar may have taken her lead from the Czech painter Franticek Foltyn, who taught her in Paris, and who incorporated similar motifs into his work. Shells and winged forms are combined with plant-like structures, and circular shapes suggest fossils, cells or embryonic forms. Agar apparently kept a fish tank in the 1930s and was intrigued by the aquariums at the zoos in London and Naples. In her autobiography (pp. 84-5) she noted that when living in Paris she had frequently visited the Jardin des Plantes, where she became fascinated by 'the bones of that protobird, the Archaeopteryx'. This may relate to the winged structure in the third segment. She added, 'I was enthralled by fossils, their muted colour and embedded beauty. They reach us as signals in time, isolated objects which take on the importance of a problem resolved at some moment far back beyond the mists of human memory. I learnt about the secrets of animal structure and from there my thoughts led easily to the problem of human structure' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240). This connection was made more concrete when Agar discovered that 'human foetuses have gills for about 12 weeks because in the evolution of our species we went though an amphibian stage' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240). \n\nAgar saw the increasing interest in the unconscious in European art as establishing 'the dominance of a feminine type of imagination over the classical and more masculine order.' She continued, 'Apart from rampant and hysterical militarism, there is no male element left in Europe for the intellectual and rational conception of life has given way to a more miraculous creative interpretation, and artistic and imaginative life is under the sway of womb-magic' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.239).\n\nAgar, who never became a mother herself, saw the painting in universal terms. She described it as 'a celebration of life, not only a single one, but Life in general on this particular and moving planet.' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240). The use of familiar, generalised images was a deliberate device used by Agar. She explained, 'I wanted to make it into a story as if told to a child, not into a scientific thesis' (quoted in Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, p.240).\n\nFurther reading:Eileen Agar in collaboration with Andrew Lambirth, A Look at My Life, London 1988, pp.234-5.Ann Simpson, with David Gascoyne and Andrew Lambirth, Eileen Agar 1899-1991, exhibition catalogue, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh 1999, pp.39-42, no.20, reproduced in colour plate 5 and on jacket.Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions 1986-88, Tate Gallery, London 1996, pp.237-41, reproduced p.237.\n\nChloe JohnsonSeptember 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on board", "date": "1933\u20134", "dimensions": "Support: 914 x 2130 mm", "reference": "T05024", "title": "The Autobiography of an Embryo", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/agar-the-autobiography-of-an-embryo-t05024", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05024_8.jpg", "artist": "Eileen Agar", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1899\u20131991", "artistbio": "\n English painter of Argentine birth.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The legend of Cupid and Psyche was extremely popular with writers and artists in the second half of the 19th Century, and this picture is typical of the classical revival in Victorian art at this time. The story is related in the Roman poet Lucius Apuleius's Metamorphoses or The Golden Ass. Psyche's beauty was so great that no man dared to approach her as a suitor. An oracle told her parents to dress her for marriage and sacrifice her, but she was transported instead to the golden palace of Cupid, the god of love. She lived there in a blissful state, waited on by slaves, and each night Cupid would make love to her, but without his identity being revealed. He later abandoned Psyche when, encouraged by her jealous sisters, she gazed on his sleeping form by the light of a lamp and inadvertently dropped hot oil on his body. \n\nThe painting shows Psyche undressing herself in order to bathe before Cupid's arrival. She is completely self-absorbed, and her narcissism is emphasised by her reflection, captured in the smooth surface of the water. The subject of a bather and the exquisite draughtsmanship clearly pay tribute to J.A.D. Ingres (1780-1867) and especially such works as La Source (1820-56, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). The woman's pose, with arms raised to reveal her naked body, derives more specifically from the Callipygian Venus, a famous Greek statue that Leighton would have seen in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. Such a subject would have been potentially shocking to a Victorian audience, but the picture appears to have met with very few moral objections when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890.\n\nLeighton was one of about 45 artists who were asked by the artist Lawrence Alma-Tadema to assist in the decoration of the atrium of his house in Grove End Road, St John's Wood (Leighton was offered one of Alma-Tadema's own paintings in exchange). Each artist was asked to paint a panel 32 inches high and between 2\u00bd and 8 inches wide. According to legend, Leighton, sitting opposite Alma-Tadema at dinner, picked up a narrow-bladed dessert knife and said to his friend, 'My dear Tadema, what sort of subject do you expect me to paint on this?' (Strand Magazine, December 1902, pp.617-8).\n\nLeighton's original panel measured 32 inches by 6\u00bd inches and even the present version is almost twice its width. The composition emphasises the picture's verticality through the soaring Ionic columns (echoed in the picture's frame) and the downward flow of Psyche's draperies.\n\nFurther reading:Stephen Jones, Christopher Newall, Leon\u00e9e Ormond, Richard Ormond, Benedict Read, Frederic Leighton 1830-1896, exhibition catalogue, Royal Academy of Arts, London 1996, pp.214-5, no.108, reproduced p.214, in colour.Alison Smith, The Victorian Nude, Sexuality, Morality and Art, Manchester 1996, p.210.\n\nFrances FowleDecember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "Exhibited 1890", "dimensions": "Support: 1892 x 622 mm", "reference": "N01574", "title": "The Bath of Psyche", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/leighton-the-bath-of-psyche-n01574", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01574_8.jpg", "artist": "Frederic, Lord Leighton", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1830\u20131896", "artistbio": "\n English painter and sculptor. He spent much of his youth travelling on the Continent with his family. This cosmopolitan background was of great importance to his development as an artist. \nBetween 1855 and 1859 Leighton was based in Paris. The period marks the beginning of a transition in his work, from the exact draughtsmanship and historical detail of the Nazarenes to a broader synthesis of influences, embracing the painterly effects of Venetian art, the realistic landscapes of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny and the classical subject-matter of Thomas Couture's followers.\nThe years 1859\u201364 were marked for Leighton critical hostility. He was increasingly preoccupied with the formal problems of academic painting. \nThe psychological content of Leighton's work became increasingly complex in the late 1860s and the 1870s. Canvases of this period frequently show the confrontation between the forces of life and death.\nLeighton's interest in sculpture was a natural extension of his increasingly sculptural treatment of the painted canvas. \nAfter his election as President of the Royal Academy in 1878, Leighton was increasingly regarded as the leader of the Victorian art establishment. The themes already dominant in his art remained constant throughout the last 20 years of his life. Increasingly in his last years a note of melancholy entered his work. Leighton died exhausted by his battle with heart disease and the demands of his public role as President of the Royal Academy. It is significant that he left no school of pupils to continue a tradition that itself was almost exhausted.\nBibliography[Mrs A. Lang]: \u2018Sir Frederic Leighton, P.R.A.', A. J.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Duchamp painted Coffee Mill for his brother, the sculptor Raymond Duchamp-Villon, who, at the time of his wedding, asked a number of his artist friends to make small works to decorate his kitchen. As Duchamp later recollected: 'I made this old-fashioned coffee mill for him. It shows the different facets of the coffee grinding operation and the handle on top is seen simultaneously in several positions as it revolves. You can see the ground coffee in a heap under the cogwheels of the central shaft, which turns in the directions of the arrow on top.' (d'Harnoncourt and McShine, p.256.)\n\nThe year after he painted Coffee Mill Duchamp attracted considerable attention exhibiting his most Cubist work, Nude Descending a Staircase, 1912 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) at the Armory Show in New York. The influence of Cubism was, however, already visible in Coffee Mill: the use of fractured lines and repeated elements to suggest the movement of the grinder were typically Cubist devices, and Duchamp himself said that the painting was 'based on the idea of \"dismantling\" the grinder' (interview with Dorothy Norman, 1953, first published in Art in America, vol.57, July-August 1969, p.38). With its diagrammatic appearance, specifically the inclusion of an arrow, Coffee Mill can also be thought of as the forerunner of all Dadaist machine imagery. 'When I painted the Coffee Mill it was the first time I became interested in machine forms', Duchamp later explained, 'the arrow indicates the direction in which the machine should turn. The handle is shown in different positions - this having to do with the idea of movement, of repetition.' (ibid. p.38)\n\nBoth functionally and symbolically Coffee Mill anticipates the role of the element identified as a chocolate grinder in Duchamp's celebrated work The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) (Tate T02011). In a series of notes written to accompany The Large Glass, Duchamp explained that, 'The bachelor grinds his chocolate himself' (Schwarz, p.573). This statement hints that the action of the Coffee Mill might also be taken as a metaphor for masturbation, and Duchamp later commented that: 'Always there has been a necessity for circles in my life, for, how do you say, rotation. It is a kind of onanism.'

He studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in 1904-5. His early figure paintings were influenced by Matisse and Fauvism, but in 1911 he created a personal brand of Cubism combining earthy colours,\nmechanical and visceral forms, and a depiction of movement which owes as much to Futurism as to Cubism. His Nude Descending a Staircase, No.2, 1912 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), created a sensation at the 1913 New York Armory Show. Duchamp did\nvery little painting after 1912, creating the first of his 'readymades' in 1913. These were ordinary objects of everyday use, sometimes slightly altered, and designated works of art by the artist. His earliest readymades included Bicycle\nWheel (1913), a wheel mounted on a wooden stool, and a snow shovel entitled In Advance of the Broken Arm (1915). One of his best-known pieces is a urinal, titled Fountain and signed 'R. Mutt', which he submitted to an exhibition\nof the Society of Independent Artists in New York in 1917. In the ensuing controversy, the concept of the readymade became associated with an assault on the conventional understanding of the nature and status of art. Duchamp also used readymades as\nparts of a private symbolic language. He spoke of how using prefabricated objects freed him from the 'trap' of developing a particular style or taste.Duchamp lived mainly in New York from 1915 to 1923, in Paris from 1923 to 1942, and returned to\nNew York in 1942. His friendship with Man Ray led to their publication of New York Dada in 1921. From 1915 to 1923 he worked on The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) , which he considered his most important\nsingle work. It was shown at the International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1927, but was badly damaged on its return journey. Duchamp repaired and partially remade it in 1936, and the piece is now in the collection of the\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art. In 1965-6, Duchamp and Richard Hamilton made a replica of the work (Tate Gallery T02011). Duchamp continued to be a figure of huge importance in the art world. He kept up an interest\nin experimental film and continued to organise exhibitions, notably the Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme in Paris in 1938. He also devoted much time to playing tournament chess. In the last twenty years of his life, he worked in\nsecret on a three-dimensional realisation of The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even, entitled Etant donn\u00e9s (Philadelphia Museum of Art). His first one-man exhibition was held at the Arts Club of Chicago in 1937.

In the early 1950s he was influenced by the work of Abstract Expressionists and produced swiftly executed pictures of trees as well as various works based on photographs. In the mid 1950s he painted spare, brightly coloured works of landscape, interiors and figures and produced simplified images in collage. These early works emphasised the flatness of the picture plane while remaining representational, and this insistence on figuration placed him outside the contemporary avant-garde mainstream, in which abstraction and chance were key qualities. He developed his style in the portrait works of ordinary people from the late 1950s. This resolution of the demands of formalism and representation looked forward to the Pop art of the following decade. In the 1960s Katz's works became more realistic and were executed in a smoother, more impersonal style. Though concentrating on figures in interiors and in urban environments, he also painted a number of landscape and flower pieces. After experimenting with the technique in the late 1950s, from the mid 1960s he made a number of free-standing cut-out figure works painted on wood or aluminium. Similarly, after early forays in the 1950s, Katz concentrated more on printmaking in the 1960s, making very simplified lithographs and screenprints.

{"info": "\n \n Display caption\n \n \n \n Vorticism was a short-lived but radical movement that emerged in London immediately before the First World War. 'The vortex is the point of maximum energy', wrote the American poet Ezra Pound, who co-founded the Vorticist journal Blast with Wyndham Lewis in June 1914. The journal opened with the 'Blast' and 'Bless' manifestos, which celebrate the machine age and Britain as the first industrialised nation. Lewis's painting Workshop epitomises Vorticism's aims, using sharp angles and shifting diagonals to suggest the geometry of modern buildings. Its harsh colours and lines echo the discordant vitality of the modern city in an 'attack on traditional harmony'. The group's aggressive rhetoric, angular style and focus on the energy of modern life linked it to Italian Futurism, though it did not share the latter's emphasis on speed and dynamism. Artists associated with Vorticism included William Roberts, Edward Wadsworth, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, CRW Nevinson and David Bomberg.

In late 1908 Lewis as painting began to publish satirical short stories that take a mechanistic view of human social behaviour, evident in the deliberately clumsy and grotesque figures in his art of the period 1909 to 1912. By 1912 he had developed his own linear vocabulary of forms, indebted to Cubist, Futurist and Expressionist forms, which gives an often ironic visual dimension to the themes of his fiction. \nLewis began to produce a geometrical and semi-abstract art based on machine and architectural forms. This was termed \u2018Vorticism' and led to the publication in July 1914 of the magazine Blast. From this period onwards Lewis became obsessed with politics and its implications for art.\nDuring World War I Lewis fought as an artillery officer in France and obtained a commission to paint pictures of the front from the Canadian Government. \nThroughout the 1920s, Lewis, posing as the \u2018enemy', produced a bewildering quantity and range of work. This imaginative work constitutes the most original body of avant-garde art produced in Britain during the 1920s. \nDuring the 1930s Lewis ran into widespread opposition to his political views, which, although far more intricate and liberal than is usually allowed, have to be described as authoritarian. \nLewis sailed to North America in 1939, eking out a living by painting, writing and lecturing.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is the last of three pictures by Orchardson that focus on the theme of the unhappy marriage. The first two in the series, Mariage de Convenance (1883, Glasgow Museums) and Mariage \u00e0 la Mode - After! (1886, Aberdeen Art Gallery) depict the disadvantages of marrying for wealth rather than for love. The elderly husband is soon abandoned by his bored young wife. In The First Cloud, the marriage is still based on an exchange of her beauty for his wealth, but the age gap is less noticeable. However, without love, the relationship lacks any firm foundation, and this first rift between the couple is merely the cloud before the storm. The picture was first exhibited at the Royal Academy with these lines from Tennyson: \n\n'It is the little rift within the lute\nThat by-and-by will make the music mute.' \n\nThe setting, as with so many of Orchardson's costume dramas, is an elegant Victorian drawing room. The wife retires from the room through a pillared arch, her graceful form silhouetted against the dark opening in the curtains. Although she turns her back to us (and to her husband) her face is vaguely reflected in a mirror in the dark room beyond. This figure was modeled by a Mrs Hope, one of a family of very beautiful sisters. For the husband Orchardson used a close friend, the artist Tom Graham. He stands by the mantelpiece, looking extremely disgruntled, and possibly rather drunk, his hands thrust in his pockets. The psychological rift that has grown between the couple is emphasized physically by the empty expanse of parquet flooring that separates them. The colours are typically muted: cool creams, pastel pinks and blues, alongside Orchardson's favorite colour combination of yellow and brown, which the French critic Ernest Chesneau described as 'harmonious as the wrong side of a tapestry.' (Wood 1999, p.257) \n\nThis is a smaller version of the painting, now in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1887 and was caricatured in Punch: The Academy Guy'd (7 May 1887, p.226). The husband, dressed as a painter, addresses the departing back of his model: \n\nYes, you can go; I've done with you, my dear.\nHere comes the model for the following year,\n(To himself) Luck in odd numbers - Anno Jubilee -\nThis is Divorce Court Series Number Three. \n\nFurther reading:\nWilliam R.

His earliest exhibited painting, Sketching from Nature (untraced), was shown at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1848. \nWhile he was still in Edinburgh, Orchardson's early work included literary subjects from Shakespeare, Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens, and themes from Scottish history. More significantly, in terms of style and composition, Orchardson's early historical works reveal the influence of Sir David Wilkie.\nIn 1862 Orchardson moved to London, where he shared a studio with John Pettie, and together these two artists were quickly recognised by critics as members of the new \u2018Scottish school', sharing characteristics of subject-matter, style, technique and composition. Throughout his career Orchardson shared technical and compositional devices and exchanged ideas about subject-matter with Pettie. They also had a similar compositional approach, using the drama of empty spaces and light-coloured backgrounds. Orchardson was elected ARA in 1868, an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1871 and RA in 1877. He was a candidate for the presidency of the Royal Academy in 1896 and was knighted in 1907.\nOrchardson produced cavalier and Regency costume pieces. He became famous for subjects from the Napoleonic era, and for contemporary upper-class psychological drama. He also painted portraits in a similar technique. His thinly applied paint was often considered sketchy or unfinished by contemporary critics more attuned to the solid finish of the English Pre-Raphaelite manner, but Whistler admired Orchardson's tonally subdued palette. His preparatory method involved delicate, full-scale charcoal studies, a collection of which is in the National Gallery of Scotland.\nBibliographyW.

When the competition for the decoration of the new Palace of Westminster was held in 1843, Dyce, probably the only man in Britain with a technical knowledge of fresco, was an obvious choice.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nPay Nothing Until April depicts precisely detailed snow-capped mountains contrasted against a yellow sky suggestive of sunset or sunrise. The low lighting casts azure blue shadows down the sides of the central peaks while the foreground is rendered by the dark silhouette of an incline that cuts across the bottom right corner of the tableau. Painted on top of this landscape is the seemingly unrelated phrase \u2018PAY NOTHING UNTIL APRIL\u2019 in a clean, modern font that is evenly spaced so that each word occupies a separate line in the centre of the picture. This work belongs to a large body of paintings, begun in the 1980s, in which Ruscha overlays natural landscapes with texts (see also Daily Planet 2003, Tate AR00048).\nTo create this work, Ruscha sprayed a thin layer of paint onto the canvas, then worked the image up in acrylic paint using medium-sized brush. The text was applied using stencils, and is presented in Boy Scout Utility Modern, a typeface of the artist\u2019s own creation described by him as a sort of \u2018no-style\u2019 (Richards 2008, p.82).\n\nPay Nothing Until April expresses a cool, detached world-view in keeping with Ruscha\u2019s conceptual works such as his photo-book (Every Building On) The Sunset Strip 1966 (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). Roughly the size of a poster that might be displayed in a shop window, the picture\u2019s alpine setting and eye-grabbing lettering call to mind an advertisement for a bargain ski holiday. Despite its ready-made appearance, however, the pairing of text and image was conceived by Ruscha who executed the montage with a high degree of finish. Nevertheless Ruscha claims to be indifferent to the eclectic source material that he amasses: \u2018I\u2019m empty headed in many ways, and don\u2019t know why I follow what I follow. Like most people, I operate on an automatic mode, and everything is an involuntary reflex. Logic flies out of the window when you\u2019re making a picture, at least it does with me. And thank God it does.\u2019 (Hayward Gallery 2010, p.63.) As with the aforementioned photo-book, which brings together images on the basis of somewhat arbitrary categorisations, Pay Nothing Until April appears to have been created in accordance with a pointedly superficial sensibility. \nRuscha has spent his entire career living and working in the southern Californian city of Los Angeles, and its film industry has had an important bearing on his work. Ruscha has confessed that, for him, the backdrops for paintings such as Pay Nothing Until April are \u2018not really mountains in the sense that a naturalist would paint a picture of a mountain. They\u2019re ideas of mountains, picturing some kind of unobtainable bliss or glory \u2026 tall, dangerous and beautiful\u2019 (quoted in Richards 2008, p.100). Appropriated from photographs and postcards or amalgamated from different mountain ranges, these scenes call to mind the mountainscapes of adventure movies such as the 1969 James Bond picture On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service or the logo of Paramount Pictures, one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest production companies, as much as they echo the sublime landscapes made popular by European Romantic painting. By deflating awe-inspiring natural imagery with the imposition of banal, consumerist text rendered in \u2018no-style\u2019, Ruscha\u2019s painting reflects the city in which he lives, a place he once referred to as \u2018the ultimate cardboard cut-out town\u2019 (quoted in Schwartz 2004, p.244).\n\nFurther reading\nAlexandra Schwartz (ed.), Leave Any Information at the Signal: Writings, Interviews, Bits, Pages, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2004.Mary Richards, Ed Ruscha.

Moving to Los Angeles in 1956, Ruscha came to prominence there in the late 1950s when he began making small collages similar to those of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Soon he began to refine his collages, isolating and recombining words and images in increasingly subtle and unique ways. Because he drew upon sources from the real world and embraced the vulgar techniques and imagery of commercial culture, his work is associated with Pop art. However, Ruscha seldom seemed to be making art about other art. Ruscha used unconventional materials in his graphic work of the late 1960s and 1970s: he drew with gunpowder and painted and printed with foodstuffs and with a variety of organic substances such as blood and the medicine Pepto-Bismol. He was well known for his depiction of words and phrases and for the books he published of his series of deadpan photographs. Such work was influential for the development of conceptual art, although Ruscha's pieces have a characteristic low-key humour. In the 1980s Ruscha's work was characterized by a further exploration of the image. A major travelling retrospective was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1982\u20133, and in 1985 Ruscha was commissioned to design a series of murals for the Miami\u2013Dade Public Library in Florida, designed by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee (b 1933).\nBibliographyE.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is Hughes's best-known work, and one of the most popular of all Pre-Raphaelite paintings. When it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1856, the accompanying catalogue contained a quotation from one of the songs in Tennyson's 'The Miller's Daughter', in which the young lovers fear the passing of their love: 'Love is hurt with jar and fret, | Love is made a sweet regret; | Eyes with idle tears are wet, | Idle habits link us yet. | What is love? for we forget: | Ah, no! no!'\n\nThe painting was not conceived as an illustration to the poem, but rather the verse reinforced Hughes's depiction of fragile young love. Hughes changed the setting from a millstream with chestnut trees and forget-me-nots to an ivy-clad arbour or summerhouse with lilac outside the window and rose petals on the stone floor. As with many of the artist's works, ivy is also used to decorate the frame. The Pre-Raphaelites often included symbolic elements in their work. Ivy signifies everlasting life, roses love. That the petals are strewn on the floor may suggest the love affair has ended. April Love was the first of a number of compositions in which Hughes depicted lovers in a landscape. It shows the influence of A Huguenot, 1852 (private collection) and Ferdinand Lured by Ariel, 1849 (private collection) by Millais, whom Hughes greatly admired. The rich blues, greens and purples employed by Hughes quickly became his trade mark.\n\nOn 26 November 1855 Hughes married 'his early and only love' Tryphena Foord. Tryphena's father managed a decorating business owned by Robert Cutbush, whose brother Thomas Robert Cutbush probably owned the garden at Maidstone in which, according to Robert Ross, April Love was painted (Burlington Magazine, vol.28, February 1916, p.171). Much of the painting, however, appears to have been done at 6 Upper Belgrave Place, London, where Hughes shared a studio with the sculptor Alexander Munro, said to have been the model for the man in the picture (letter from Margaret Munro, 20 August 1959, in Tate Gallery files). According to Hughes's pupil Albert Goodwin, writing in 1916, the face of the girl was originally modelled from a country girl, but she disliked the way Hughes was painting her and left. The final model was probably Tryphena. \n\nThe painting was known by several titles prior to its exhibition as April Love. Ford Madox Brown wrote in his diary on 9 September 1855: 'Last night I had the mulligrubs &amp; went for the first time to Munnros &amp; saw Hughes picture of the Lovers quarrel - it is very beautiful indeed. The girl is lovely, draperies &amp; all, but the greens of his foliage were so acid that made my mulligrubs worse I do think' (V. Surtees, ed., The Diary of Ford Madox Brown, New Haven and London 1981, p.153). Hughes, writing to the poet William Allingham, recalled the latter's suggestion that it should be called Hide and Seek: 'You remember the picture of a girl you saw unfinished ( and suggested my calling \"Hide and Seek\" ( now completed and rejoicing in the more graceful title of \"April Love.\" Ruskin saw, went into enthusiastic admiration, and brought his Father to try to induce him to purchase it, but alas fate willed otherwise' (H. Allingham and E. Baumer Williams, eds., Letters to William Allingham, London 1911, p.62). Ruskin continued to express enthusiasm for the picture, however, calling it in his Academy Notes for 1856 'Exquisite in every way; lovely in colour, most subtle in the quivering expression of the lips, and sweetness of the tender face, shaken, like a leaf by winds upon its dew, and hesitating back into peace (Cook &amp; Wedderburn, eds., The Works of John Ruskin, XIV, London 1904, p.68). The picture was bought at the Royal Academy exhibition by the designer William Morris, who wrote to Edward Burne-Jones on 17 May asking him to 'do me a great favour, viz. go and nobble that picture called \"April Love\" as soon as possible lest anybody else should buy it' (G.

Although a Pre-Raphaelite\nsympathiser and intimate of their circle, Hughes was never a member of the group. He converted to Pre-Raphaelitism in 1850 after reading the Pre-Raphaelite magazine The Germ; in the same year he met William Holman Hunt, D.G. Rossetti and Ford\nMadox Brown. He exhibited his first Pre-Raphaelite painting, Ophelia (Manchester City Art Gallery), in 1852, and met Millais that year. He produced some of his best-known Pre-Raphaelite works during the 1850s, including April Love,\n1855-6 (Tate Gallery N02476) and The Long Engagement, c.1854-9 (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery). From about 1852 to 1858 he shared a studio with the sculptor Alexander Munro. He married\nTryphena Foord in 1855, eventually having five children. In 1855 he also began a successful career as an illustrator, becoming associated particularly with the works of Thomas Hughes, George Macdonald and Christina Rossetti. He devoted much of the\nsubsequent two decades to illustrating. He was one of the contributors to the Oxford Union decorations in 1857. He moved from London in 1858 and in 1862 made a short visit to Italy. He exhibited for the last time at the Royal Academy in 1908. He died at\nKew, near London.

Vanessa had also married Clive Bell, by whom she had two sons. The entry of Roger Fry into Bloomsbury in 1910 radically altered Vanessa Bell's life and art. Her painting, boldly simplified, was now shorn of all detail and intrusive sentiment. Her willingness to experiment placed her in the forefront of the avant-garde, and she was one of the first in England to essay a non-representational style. She was closely involved in the early stages of the Omega Workshops and retained a lifelong interest in decorative schemes, bringing pattern and colour into everyday domestic surroundings.\nLike other artists of her generation she reverted to a more naturalistic style after World War I.

She turned instead to decorative work, emulating Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant but in a style more native in inspiration and more naive. She designed tiles and inn signs, experimented with painting on glass and tinfoil, decorated furniture and designed the library at Ham Spray. Emotional relationships further diversified her interests and much of her creative energy went into her letters which, with their mongrel prose, inimitable spelling and spontaneous illustrations, provide an exceptional insight into her life and character.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nLight Bulbs is a large oil painting by Lisa Milroy of various types of domestic light bulb arranged in neat groupings and pictured with prominent shadows on an anonymous white surface. Milroy\u2019s depiction of the objects has both realistic and impressionistic qualities: the bulbs are life-like in their execution and volume, yet they seem to quiver and flicker on the canvas. There is also perhaps a gem-like aspect to the objects, with their brass and aluminum fittings gleaming like gold and silver, and the smallest pieces taking on the appearance of diamonds or jewels. Milroy has stated that the painting should remain unframed.\nBorn in Canada, Milroy has lived and worked in London since 1978, when she moved to the city to study first at Saint Martin\u2019s School of Art and then at Goldsmith\u2019s College (where she graduated in 1982). Domestic items, including clothes, shoes and books, were the focus of her work from the beginning of her career. The artist painted these objects quickly and from memory, and using only eight colours to mix her paints. As she explained in a 2005 interview with curator Lewis Biggs:\n\nDuring the 1980s, I painted most of my still life paintings in a single day. I had to work while the entire surface of the painting was wet in a bid to keep thought and action bound as one thing. If I stopped for any length of time, I lost the connection between the two and the painting fell apart.\n(Quoted in Alan Cristea Gallery 2005, p.5.)\n\nTowards the late 1980s the objects in Milroy\u2019s work, which now extended from domestic items to Greek vases and Roman coins, were gradually spread out in more systematic arrangements. This work is one of five paintings of light bulbs Milroy created between 1988 and 1992, while Handles 1988 (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which also depicts what might be a display in a hardware store, was awarded first prize in the John Moores Painting Prize in 1989. From the 1990s onwards Milroy began to paint buildings, cityscapes, animals and people, as well as objects.\nIn their repetitive depiction of consumer products, Milroy\u2019s paintings might be seen in relation to earlier movements featuring arrays of goods, such as pop art. However, her work may perhaps be more closely connected to painters who do not sit squarely within the pop tradition, such as the American artists Wayne Thiebaud (born 1920), who painted imaginary displays of cakes and hot dogs, and Jasper Johns (born 1930). Indeed, Biggs has suggested that Milroy\u2019s object paintings might be aligned with Johns\u2019s famous series depicting the American flag, as in both cases the artist produces \u2018abstract paintings using an image that is also an object in a way that both recognises and empties out its everyday meanings\u2019 (Biggs, Bradley and Criqui 2001, p.9).\n\nLight Bulbs, the first work by the artist to be acquired by Tate, was initially displayed as part of Milroy\u2019s show at the Nicola Jacobs Gallery, London, in May 1988.

Her first solo exhibition, in 1984, was of small still-life paintings depicting common objects, either singly or in sets. These were technically remarkable works. Her subsequent series of paintings of objects in groups (rows, clusters, layers or grids) borrowed the language of hardware catalogues, shop display windows and formal arrangements in art and photography, while yet creating autonomous visual statements. Sometimes her arrangement of objects was influenced by their functional identity, so that, for example, stamps become islands for the eyes to travel between or wheels speed forward at an unstoppable visual pace. Later works continued to emphasise the arrangement of objects in relation to the picture plane, and in such works as Plates (1992; London, Nicola Jacobs and Tony Schlesinger priv. col.), in which four blocks of plates are presented in rows of four, six, three and five against a plain mid-grey background, an element of time was also introduced by giving the view of each block from a different height.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Juan Gris first began to paint in a cubist manner in 1912 and, under the influence of his close friends Picasso and Braque, he quickly progressed through analytical cubism, with its faceted forms and shifting perspectives, to synthetic cubism, using overlapping flat planes of colour and texture.\n\nIn this most radical form of the cubist idiom, nature was no longer a necessary starting point. Instead, coloured planes could provide the architecture for imagery that the artist could develop towards something representative. Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who was Gris\u2019s close friend and dealer, wrote of the artist\u2019s method: \u2018He started with the ensemble, whose rhythm he allowed to develop freely. From this rhythm sprang, in their turn, the objects. A few simple \u201cstimulants\u201d sufficed to make the spectator \u201csee\u201d the desired object. Parallel lines drawn on a white surface changed it into a page of music; lines of type turned it into a newspaper; a flatly drawn ring made it into a plate.\u2019 (Kahnweiler 1969, p.146.) Objects in such works were often no more than signs, which had to be read imaginatively by the spectator in order to be understood.\n\nIn Bottle of Rum and Newspaper Gris constructed the image from intersecting angular planes. Many of these have fake wood grain, suggestive perhaps of a wooden table top, though the way they overlap and interlock denies any possibility of recession or perspective. The bottle and the newspaper are indicated with a bare minimum of clues: a few letters, an outline and hint of local colour are sufficient to indicate the identity of the objects. The complexity of the work, however, lies in the suggestion that the overlapping and interpenetrating planes may represent to some degree visual memories of different views onto the objects. Such a painting, Kahnweiler was to insist, was conceptual in the sense that it was to be understood fully only through the use of the spectator\u2019s imagination.\n\nFurther reading\nDaniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Juan Gris: His Life and Work, translated by Douglas Cooper, London 1969\nJennifer Mundy, \u2018Juan Gris\u2019, in Jennifer Mundy (ed.), Cubism and its Legacy: The Gift of Gustav and Elly Kahnweiler, exhibition catalogue, Tate Modern, London 2004, pp.34-44, reproduced p.37 in colour\n\nJennifer Mundy\nDecember 2003\nRevised by Giorgia Bottinelli\nJune 2004\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1913\u20134", "dimensions": "Support: 460 x 370 mm", "reference": "T06808", "title": "Bottle of Rum and Newspaper", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gris-bottle-of-rum-and-newspaper-t06808", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06808_8.jpg", "artist": "Juan Gris", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1887\u20131927", "artistbio": "\n Juan Gris 1887-1927School of Paris painter of still life and occasional figure subjects;\none of the leading Cubists.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Orpen was commissioned into the Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant in March 1916, and worked as a clerk at Kensington Barracks. But under the war artist's scheme, in January 1917 he was released from these duties, given the rank of major, and, in April, arrived in Amiens. Orpen was only the second war artist to be appointed, after Muirhead Bone (1876-1953), and he was employed full time to record the conflict. In the spring and summer of 1917 he painted the battlefields of the Somme, sometimes at places that had been captured only a short time earlier. Orpen described in a letter the shocking experience of seeing numbers of corpses lying unburied among the flooded shell holes, in a landscape totally empty of life. In his pictures of the blasted battlefields, and in his portraits of the exhausted or shell-shocked men, Orpen got physically and emotionally closer to the full horrors of the First World War than most of the other official artists.\n\nBefore being presented to the Imperial War Museum, these works were exhibited at Agnew's in London in May 1918, to immense popular acclaim. The public responded positively to the frankness of Orpen's brutal realism, and the exhibition secured Orpen his knighthood. He returned to France in July 1918, and remained there almost constantly until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. During this period Orpen began to paint more overtly allegorical compositions about the War and many portraits of the delegates to the Peace Conference. But he also recorded a few further battlefield scenes, like Zonnebeke, made in the style of his pictures of the previous year. Zonnebeke, in Flanders, was the scene of bitter fighting as part of the Passchendaele campaign from June to November 1917. A massive British offensive against enemy installations initially succeeded brilliantly. But prolonged rainfall and heavy shelling transformed the battlefield into a swamp, and the Germans, operating from concrete pillboxes, took a heavy toll of Allied troops with mustard gas and machine-gun fire. At some points at Zonnebeke the Allied and German trenches there were just seven yards apart, and there was terrible loss of life. In a series of attacks and counter-attacks Zonnebeke itself was completely destroyed. When the British finally halted the Passchendaele offensive in November 1917, both sides had each lost 250,000 men, and the Allied lines had advanced just five miles.\n\nOrpen's experience of the War changed him forever. While enormously successful afterwards as portraitist to the British establishment, he remained bitter about the human loss and blamed the politicians and generals for asking the ordinary soldier to make unbearable sacrifices. In 1921 he published an account of his time as a war artist in An Onlooker in France 1917-1919. This contained passages which derided the politicians' cynicism, but was nevertheless hailed by the Daily Express as 'The most frank, unconventional, humorous, tragic human book about the Great War that has been written'.\n\nFurther reading:Sir William Orpen, An Onlooker in France 1917-1919, London 1921Bruce Arnold, Orpen: Mirror to an Age, London, 1981, pp.308-80\n\nRobert UpstoneFebruary 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1918", "dimensions": "Support: 635 x 762 mm", "reference": "T07694", "title": "Zonnebeke", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/orpen-zonnebeke-t07694", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07694_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir William Orpen", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1878\u20131931", "artistbio": "\n Irish painter.

The influence of Vel\u00e1zquez, in particular, is apparent in such early genre subjects as The Mirror (1900; London, Tate). His bravura portrait style was probably also indebted to Manet: his Homage to Manet (1909; Manchester, C.A.G.) was a group portrait of members of the New English Art Club, including Philip Wilson Steer, Walter Richard Sickert, Dugald Sutherland MacColl and Henry Tonks, sitting beneath Manet's portrait of Eva Gonzal\u00e8s (London, N.G.). Orpen was financially one of the most successful, and eventually one of the most honoured, portrait painters working in Britain in the twentieth century. \nIn 1917 Orpen was appointed an Official War Artist. An exhibition of his war paintings, watercolours and drawings was held in London in the spring of 1918.In his illustrations to An Onlooker in France, 1917\u20131919 (1921), Orpen depicted scenes of trench warfare, often in grim detail, but he found it difficult in his larger paintings to come to terms with the broader implications of the war. He received a knighthood in June 1918 and was elected ARA in 1910 and RA in 1921. Orpen's production of paintings and drawings, in spite of the relative brevity of his life, is impressively large: he worked quickly and drew almost daily, usually for long hours.\nBibliographyP. G.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Ski Jacket is a large painting in diptych format. The two parts, of the same height but different width, are joined at the approximate centre of the image, the right side being narrower than the left. The two parts mirror each other inexactly around the central axis constituted by the join. Doig created the image depicted in Ski Jacket from a photograph of learner skiers on a Japanese mountain, centering the painting on a dense clump of dark green pine trees that straddles the join. On the right side of the painting white, geometric buildings are partially concealed behind a sparser group of trees. Above these, at the top right side, a triangular formation partly covered in white evokes a mountain peak. At the bottom, in the foreground, a different kind of tree has been painted in a lighter green. Tiny human figures in brightly coloured clothes of the type usually worn by skiers are dotted all over the canvas. Horizontal streaks of white paint represent the snow covering the landscape on both sides of the painting. Applied in thin washes, the paint has been allowed to dribble down the canvas, creating a blurred effect. The left side is dominated by areas of pink and golden yellow, from which more white geometric buildings and the odd pine tree stand out bleakly. Further outlines of fir trees painted in golden brown suggest the fading or degeneration of an old print, also evoked by the abstract areas of paint above them. Large patches of white above the buildings \u2013 describing clouds or more snow \u2013 echo the triangular mountain peak of the right side. In the foreground, a large yellow area is broken up by patches of white in which little human figures are roughly painted. Doig has commented: \n\n\nSki Jacket\n... is about the fumbling and awkwardness when learning to ski, how when you start skiing you slip all over the place, yet over a period of time you learn to cope and eventually manage to ski. Ski Jacket depicts beginner skiers. If you look carefully you can see that they are all groping to stay on their feet, they are in very awkward positions, and whilst there are other things going on in that painting, that sense of awkwardness was one of the things that attracted me to that image. And I think painting is a bit like that, it takes time to actually take control of the \u2018greasy\u2019 stuff \u2013 paint. But I have also used the way you perceive things when you are in the mountains; for example when you are feeling warm in an otherwise cold environment, and how the light is often extreme and accentuated by wearing different coloured goggles. I\u2019ve used that as a way of accentuating the colours in the paintings, to the extent that they appear seemingly psychedelic. There used to be these rose-tinted goggles that made everything look as pink as cotton candy.\n\n(Quoted in Scott, p.20.)\n\n\nDoig has made several paintings depicting snow, inspired by seeing the colours in snowscapes painted by Claude Monet (1840-1926) towards the end of his life, in an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 1990. He has said: \u2018I often paint scenes with snow because snow somehow has this effect of drawing you inwards and is frequently used to suggest retrospection and nostalgia and make-believe\u2019 (quoted in Bonaventura, p.13). He spent most of his childhood and adolescence in rural Quebec where snow sports were common activities. His first painting of snow, Pink Snow 1994 (Ole Faarup, Denmark), depicts a figure in a heavy pink snowfall. It was followed in the mid 1990s by a series of paintings depicting snow sports. \n\nMirroring and reflection are common compositional devices in Doig\u2019s paintings. Pink Mountain 1996 (Bailey Collection, Toronto) also uses the diptypch format but without the mirroring effect. In Ski Jacket the variations in the two sides emphasise the artificiality of representational painting and its relationship to printing and other forms of mechanical reproduction. Doig paints from many sources, usually originating in a photograph which he then manipulates by photocopying, drawing or painting over and photocopying again. He paints landscapes but his interest in the landscape is as an experience or mood, rather than the depiction of an actual scene. His representations of nature always contain evidence of human presence, often in uneasy relation to the natural setting. He has explained that \u2018a lot of the work deals with peripheral or marginal sites, places where the urban world meets the natural world. Where the urban elements almost become, literally, abstract devices.\u2019 (Quoted in Scott, p.19.) A desire to show the buildings within the landscape was another contributing factor to his choice of image in Ski Jacket. Denuded of trees, the area around them has a bleak, barren quality, which undercuts the cozy atmosphere depicted in other parts of the painting. \n\nFurther reading:\nKitty Scott, Peter Doig, exhibition catalogue, Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Power Plant, Toronto 2001, pp.7-10, 12, 20, reproduced (colour) p.32.\nPeter Doig: Blizzard seventy-seven, exhibition catalogue, Kunsthalle zu Kiel, Kunsthalle \nNurnberg, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 1998, reproduced (colour) pp.94-5, pl.13.\nPaul Bonaventura, \u2018Peter Doig: A Hunter in the Snow\u2019, Artefactum, autumn 1994, XI, 53, pp.12-15.\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nOctober 2002/January 2007\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on 2 canvases", "date": "1994", "dimensions": "Support, right: 2953 x 1604 x 33 mm", "reference": "T06962", "title": "Ski Jacket", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/doig-ski-jacket-t06962", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06962_8.jpg", "artist": "Peter Doig", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1959", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

Doig's paintings are noted for their intriguing balance of figuration and abstract surface qualities. Often working from photographs and films, Doig uses a broad range of subjects, exploring the general theme of man's relation with his environment. The surfaces of his paintings, especially those from the early 1990s, appear complex and tangled, offering frustrated, interrupted views. Concrete Cabin West Side (1994) shows a typically luminescent view through dark trees of Le Corbusier's Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation at Briey-en-For\u00eat in France, shrouding this monument to Modernist idealism in pagan mystery. The influence of the Canadian landscape, as well as of Doig's own leisure interests, can be seen in the painting Ski Jacket (1994; London, Tate), a view of a busy ski resort. Acid colours and a loose technique suggest comparisons with Post-Impressionists such as Bonnard, while the attention paid to contemporary leisure space can be compared with the work of the German photographer Andreas Gursky. His use and exploration of popular culture can be seen in the paintings Buffalo Station I and Buffalo Station II (both 1997\u20138), mirrored views of people emerging from a stadium in Buffalo, NY, after a 1997 Rolling Stones concert.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This painting depicts a splash in a Californian swimming pool. Hockney first visited Los Angeles in 1963, a year after graduating from the Royal College of Art, London. He returned there in 1964 and remained, with only intermittent trips to Europe, until 1968 when he came back to London. In 1976 he made a final trip back to Los Angeles and set up permanent home there. He was drawn to California by the relaxed and sensual way of life. He commented: \u2018the climate is sunny, the people are less tense than in New York ... When I arrived I had no idea if there was any kind of artistic life there and that was the least of my worries.\u2019 (Quoted in Kinley, [p.4].) In California, Hockney discovered, everybody had a swimming pool. Because of the climate, they could be used all year round and were not considered a luxury, unlike in Britain where it is too cold for most of the year. Between 1964 and 1971 he made numerous paintings of swimming pools. In each of the paintings he attempted a different solution to the representation of the constantly changing surface of water. His first painted reference to a swimming pool is in the painting California Art Collector 1964 (private collection). Picture of a Hollywood Swimming Pool 1964 (private collection) was completed in England from a drawing. While his later swimming pools were based on photographs, in the mid 1960s Hockney\u2019s depiction of water in swimming pools was consciously derived from the influences of his contemporary, the British painter Bernard Cohen (born 1933), and the later abstract paintings by French artist Jean Dubuffet (1901-85). At this time he also began to leave wide borders around the paintings unpainted, a practice developed from his earlier style of keeping large areas of the canvas raw. At the same time, he discovered fast-drying acrylic paint to be more suited to portraying the sun-lit, clean-contoured suburban landscapes of California than slow drying oil paint. \n\nA Bigger Splash was painted between April and June 1967 when Hockney was teaching at the University of California at Berkeley. The image is derived in part from a photograph Hockney discovered in a book on the subject of building swimming pools. The background is taken from a drawing he had made of Californian buildings. A Bigger Splash is the largest and most striking of three \u2018splash\u2019 paintings. The Splash (private collection) and A Little Splash (private collection) were both completed in 1966. They share compositional characteristics with the later version. All represent a view over a swimming pool towards a section of low-slung, 1960s modernist architecture in the background. A diving board juts out of the margin into the paintings\u2019 foreground, beneath which the splash is represented by areas of lighter blue combined with fine white lines on the monotone turquoise water. The positioning of the diving board \u2013 coming at a diagonal out of the corner \u2013 gives perspective as well as cutting across the predominant horizontals. The colours used in A Larger Splash are deliberately brighter and bolder than in the two smaller paintings in order to emphasise the strong Californian light. The yellow diving board stands out dramatically against the turquoise water of the pool, which is echoed in the intense turquoise of the sky. Between sky and water, a strip of flesh-coloured land denotes the horizon and the space between the pool and the building. This is a rectangular block with two plate glass windows, in front of which a folding chair is sharply delineated. Two palms on long, spindly trunks ornament the painting\u2019s background while others are reflected in the building\u2019s windows. A frond-like row of greenery decorates its front. The blocks of colour were rollered onto the canvas and the detail, such as the splash, the chair and the vegetation, painted on later using small brushes. The painting took about two weeks to complete, providing an interesting contrast with his subject matter for the artist. Hockney has explained: \u2018When you photograph a splash, you\u2019re freezing a moment and it becomes something else. I realise that a splash could never be seen this way in real life, it happens too quickly. And I was amused by this, so I painted it in a very, very slow way.\u2019 (Quoted in Kinley, [p.5].) He had rejected the possibility of recreating the splash with an instantaneous gesture in liquid on the canvas. In contrast with several of his earlier swimming pool paintings, which contain a male subject, often naked and viewed from behind, the \u2018splash\u2019 paintings are empty of human presence. However, the splash beneath the diving board implies the presence of a diver.\n\nFurther reading:\nDavid Hockney: Paintings, Prints and Drawings 1960-1970, exhibition catalogue, Whitechapel Gallery, London 1970\nStephanie Barron, Maurice Tuchman, David Hockney: A Retrospective, exhibition catalogue, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Tate Gallery, London 1988, p.38, reproduced p.158, pl.37 in colour and p.39, fig.24 (detail)\nCatherine Kinley, David Hockney: Seven Paintings, exhibition brochure, Tate Gallery, London 1992, [p.5], reproduced [p.5] in colour\n\nCatherine Kinley/Elizabeth Manchester\nFebruary 1992/March 2003\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1967", "dimensions": "Support: 2425 x 2439 x 30 mm", "reference": "T03254", "title": "A Bigger Splash", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hockney-a-bigger-splash-t03254", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03254_8.jpg", "artist": "David Hockney", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1937", "artistbio": "\n English painter, printmaker, photographer and stage designer. Perhaps the most popular and versatile British artist of the 20th century, Hockney made apparent his facility as a draughtsman while studying at Bradford School of Art between 1953 and 1957. \nHockney soon sought ways of reintegrating a personal subject-matter into his art. He began tentatively by copying fragments of poems on to his paintings, encouraging a close scrutiny of the surface and creating a specific identity for the painted marks through the alliance of word and image. These cryptic messages soon gave way to open declarations in a series of paintings produced in 1960\u201361 on the theme of homosexual love. \nHockney's subsequent development was a continuation of his student work, although a significant change in his approach occurred after his move to California at the end of 1963. It is clear that when he moved to that city it was, at least in part, in search of the fantasy that he had formed of a sensual and uninhibited life of athletic young men, swimming pools, palm trees and perpetual sunshine. \nOn his arrival in California, Hockney changed from oil to acrylic paints, applying them as a smooth surface of flat and brilliant colour that helped to emphasise the pre-eminence of the image. By the end of the decade Hockney's anxieties about appearing modern had abated to the extent that he was able to pare away the devices and to allow his naturalistic rendering of the world to speak for itself.\nBibliographyDavid Hockney: Paintings, Prints and Drawings, 1960\u201370 (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This work, one of the liveliest pictures Zoffany produced during his six years in India, is an important record of British colonial life in that country in the late eighteenth century. While India was a common destination for British landscape painters and minor portraitists seeking new and stimulating experiences, it was unusual for an important portrait painter such as Zoffany to make the arduous journey. However, after earning the displeasure of Queen Charlotte over his Tribuna picture, he found himself out of favour and new commissions were not forthcoming. He landed in Calcutta in September 1783.\n\nThe painting depicts a cock match between Asaf-ud-daula, Nawab Wazir of Oudh (standing in the centre) and Colonel John Mordaunt (standing on the left in white), a keen cock-fighter who had brought out from England game-cocks which he was confident would defeat native-bred birds. The outcome of the match is unknown. Cock-fighting was widely regarded as a vicious, ungentlemanly sport. Captain Robert Smith wrote in the 1830s: 'This barbarous amusement is a particular favourite with the people of Lucknow and is as great a source of demoralisation here, as it is in every country where the custom prevails' (quoted in M. Archer, India and British Portraiture 1770-1825, London 1979, p.148). The picture was commissioned in 1784 by Warren Hastings, the 1st Governor-General of Bengal, shortly before his return to England in 1785. He may have admired a simpler version Zoffany painted for Asaf. Hastings is not in the picture, although his diary records that he was present at Mordaunt's cock fight of 5 April 1784. Zoffany arrived in Lucknow to work for him on 3 June, and was paid 15,000 rupees (about \u00a31,500). The painting was finished after Hastings's return to England and was despatched to him in February 1788. At one time, the picture was thought to have been lost at sea, and this a copy made by Zoffany, but this is now generally discounted. \n\nAsaf's court at Lucknow was the most extravagant of the native courts, attracting numerous European adventurers lured by the financial prospects and exotic lifestyle. Faiz Bakhsh wrote that Asaf's 'natural inclinations and attachments were for low, ill-born and base-minded associates ... He delighted in meaningless amusements and was immensely pleased with anyone who indulged in filthy language; and the more obscene the conversation was in any company, the better he was pleased' (quoted in Archer, p.143). The illiterate Mordaunt was a particular favourite. An illegitimate son of the Earl of Peterborough, he was commander of the Nawab's bodyguard and leader of court amusements, including the cock-fights. At Lucknow, Indians and Europeans enjoyed social equality and personal friendship. Many Europeans had Indian wives, or bibis, and children. The central figures of the Lucknow court are portrayed here: Colonel Antoine Polier (in a red coat, standing under the awning), a Swiss officer who was engineer to the Nawab and possessor of several bibis and a number of children; John Wombwell (seated to the right holding a hookah), the East India Company's paymaster at Lucknow; and below them (in uniform, seated on the dais) the French adventurer Claud Martin. The notorious Martin kept four wives and was, among other things, the only man ever known to have successfully performed a surgical operation on himself. Lord Valentia wrote in an account after Martin's death: 'a more infamous or despicable character ... never existed. He had not a single virtue, though he laboured to assume the appearance of several' (quoted in Philip Davies, Splendours of the Raj, London 1985, pp.93-4). Standing beside Wombwell is the artist Ozias Humphrey with a hand on Zoffany's shoulder. Standing at the far right corner, wearing a blue coat and holding a white bird, is Robert Gregory, the assistant to the Governor-General's representative. Gregory was reportedly cut out of his father's will for cock-fighting. The rotund European in white, sitting in the right foreground with a fighting-cock, is Lieutenant Golding of the East India Company's Corps of Engineers.\n\nAfter its acquisition by the Tate the painting was cleaned, revealing new subtleties of colour, detail and meaning. The Nawab's state of sexual arousal, his agitated pose and inclination towards his chief minister and favourite bodyguard Hassan Resa Khan (in the ornate red turban), add an erotic dimension to the nature of the cock fight. The vignette just behind the Nawab shows a bearded Hindu (in turban) fondling a Moslem boy catamite (in the white cap worn by Moslem men), to the outrage of the man in the red turban who must be restrained by a courtier. Lewis Ferdinand Smith recounted that the Nawab 'has many adopted children, but none of his own' - despite a harem of 500 beauties - and that towards his wife of sixteen years 'he has never fulfilled the duties of a husband' (quoted in Archer, p.144). This painting was perhaps Hastings's select joke, a memento of his time in India. \n\nFurther reading:\nMildred Archer, India and British Portraiture 1770-1825, London 1979, pp.130-77\n\nTerry Riggs\nOctober 1997\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1784\u20136", "dimensions": "Support: 1039 x 1500 x 20 mm", "reference": "T06856", "title": "Colonel Mordaunt\u2019s Cock Match", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/zoffany-colonel-mordaunts-cock-match-t06856", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06856_8.jpg", "artist": "Johan Zoffany", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1733\u20131810", "artistbio": "\n Known primarily as a painter of portraits, conversation pieces and theatrical subjects, Zoffany was born\nJohannes Josephus Zauffaly, in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. The son of an architect and court cabinet maker, he was brought up at the court of Alexander Ferdinand, Prince von Thurn und Taxis, and enjoyed court patronage throughout his career. When the\nPrince took up residence at Regensburg, Johan was apprenticed to a local painter, Martin Speer (c.1702-65). Upon completion of his apprenticeship, he made the first of two trips to Rome in 1750, studying with the portrait painter Masucci. On a\nsecond trip a short time later, he made the acquaintance of Piranesi. Zoffany arrived in England around 1760 but, hindered in part by his poor English, initially was obliged to take work for the clockmaker Stephen Rimbault, painting scenes for\nclock-faces. He then worked in the studio of Benjamin Wilson (1721-88), a minor portraitist, as a drapery painter. His career in England was established when the actor-manager David Garrick became his first major English patron. Zoffany painted four\nconversation pieces of the Garrick household in 1762, as well as numerous theatrical pictures which brought him to the attention of the public and, more importantly, Queen Charlotte, who became his patron. Zoffany exhibited at the Society of\nArtists from 1762 to 1769. He was nominated by George III for membership in the Royal Academy in 1769, exhibiting there from 1770 to 1800. Between 1772 and 1778 he worked primarily in Florence, where he painted The Interior of the Tribuna at\nFlorence (Royal Collection). He returned to London in 1779 but, after a falling out with the King and Queen over his Tribuna, went to India in 1783, remaining until 1789. By 1809, according to the diarist Farington in his entry for 14\nMarch of that year, 'Zoffany's faculties were gone. He is become childish' (Kathryn Cave (ed.), The Diary of Joseph Farington, IX, New Haven and London 1982, p.3421). He died at his home at Strand-on-the-Green and is buried in Kew Churchyard\nnear London.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nFlight of the Magnolia is part of a group of late works by Paul Nash that feature what the artist called \u2018aerial flowers\u2019. The painting depicts an unfurling magnolia blossom in flight, suspended between clouds and sea. Both the fleshy folds of the magnolia\u2019s rounded petals and the seascape behind are realised in a pastel palette of pinks and blues, creating the impression of delicate dawn light. Nash made three versions of the painting during the summer of 1944, when he was living in Oxford, producing two near-identical watercolours on paper (now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California) before working up this larger, final version in thickly applied oil paint.\nElements of this scene may be traced to a trip that Nash made in September 1943 to Dorset with his close friend Lance Sieveking, a British writer and BBC producer. During this visit, Nash made a quick study of a magnolia flower given to him by another friend, Gillian Barnard. \u2018For months\u2019, Nash later wrote in a letter to Barnard,\n\nthe drawing remained just another study yet I felt quite certain it had a more important destiny. Then just recently I arrived at my \u2018aerial flowers\u2019 series \u2026 the magnolia became air borne &amp; it took to the element as a duck to water ... If you like the picture, feel you helped to make it or indeed caused it.\n(Quoted in Pennie Denton, \u2018Paul Nash and the Blue Pool\u2019, Dorset Life \u2013 The Dorset Magazine, May 2013, pp.46\u20137.)\n\nIn his own recollections of the trip, Sieveking links Flight of the Magnolia to an unusual cloud formation that he and Nash glimpsed on their last morning in Dorset (Sieveking 1957, pp.79\u201383).\nDespite these connections, the setting of Flight of the Magnolia is left undefined. In this respect, the painting differs from much of Nash\u2019s previous work, which explores the character of specific landscapes. Rather than pursuing this tendency, Flight of the Magnolia\u2019s vision of a flower in the sky brings Nash\u2019s early interest in the mystical qualities of paintings by Samuel Palmer and William Blake \u2013 evident in works such as The Pyramids in the Sea 1912 (Tate T01821) \u2013 to bear on his longstanding fascination with flight and the sky. These subjects gained new emphasis for the artist during the late 1930s, as military attacks from the air became an increasing threat. In an essay from 1945, named after his \u2018aerial flowers\u2019 series, Nash describes how the Second World War affected his perception of the sky:\n\nWhen the war came, suddenly the sky was upon us all like a huge hawk, hovering, threatening. Everyone was searching the sky, expecting the terror to fall: I among them scanned the low clouds \u2026 hunting the sky for what I most dreaded in my imagining. It was a white flower. Ever since the Spanish Civil War the idea of the Rose of Death, the name the Spaniards gave to the parachute, had haunted my mind, so that when the war overtook us I strained my eyes always to see that dreadful miracle of the sky blossoming with these floating flowers.\n(Nash 1945, pp.158\u20139.)\n\nWhile the flower in Flight of the Magnolia may be seen to relate to this vision, Nash also suggests in the same essay that his sky-bound flowers serve as \u2018equivalents\u2019 for his imaginative activity more generally (Nash 1945, pp.160\u20131). At the end of the essay, he addresses his experiments with airborne flowers in light of his own mortality: \u2018it is death I have been writing about all this time \u2026 death, I believe, is the only solution to this problem of how to be able to fly\u2019 (Nash 1945, pp.160\u20131). Many writers on Nash have highlighted this conclusion when interpreting Flight of the Magnolia, which was painted when the artist\u2019s health was in decline, and just two years before his death. For example, Nash\u2019s first biographer, Anthony Bertram, describes the image as \u2018the last flight of the soul \u2026 in the form of a flower\u2019 (Bertram 1955, pp.296\u20137).\nThe mysterious image in Nash\u2019s painting provided the basis for a recent 16mm film, Our Magnolia 2009, by the British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, which begins and ends with two extended shots of the canvas.\n\nFurther reading\nPaul Nash, \u2018Aerial Flowers\u2019, Counterpoint, no.1, 1945, pp.1\u20138, reprinted in Andrew Causey (ed.), Paul Nash: Writings on Art, Oxford 2000, pp.135\u201361.Anthony Bertram, Paul Nash: The Portrait of An Artist, London 1955, pp.296\u20137.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n \nThe painting was executed on two pieces of heavy-weight, plain-weave cotton canvas that were sewn together. The join runs vertically, approximately 160 cm from the left edge. The resulting canvas was stretched around a softwood expandable stretcher and attached with wire staples at the rear. The stretcher is also constructed out of two smaller stretchers that are bolted together along the central vertical join. A white primer (acrylic emulsion gesso) was then applied directly to the cotton canvas. This was executed with a flat implement and in a reasonable thickness (i.e. a number of layers) so that the resulting surface is extremely smooth, without any canvas texture remaining apparent.\n\n\n\nThe letters were executed in a red 'poster colour' marker pen, which was applied through stencils that were cut out of sheets of 'vinyl' plastic. Pencil lines that would have marked out the position of these stencils are still visible on the masking tape that covers the edges of the painting. Small pencil marks are also visible across the bottom of each row of letters, approximately every 50 cm. The red ink is fairly transparent, but was applied in moderately thick application and so appears more opaque in some areas. In addition, the amount of ink used has caused some smudging to occur.\n\n\n\nThe painting is in relatively good condition. The white paint layer is, however, extremely prone to dirt and fingermarks, so it is essential that it be displayed behind a barrier and handled as little as possible. The lightfastness of the red marker pen is also of concern, although fading tests carried out through the scientific section of the conservation department have suggested that it is not a particularly fugitive colour.\n\n\n\nTom Learner\nJuly 2000\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Marker pen and acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1998", "dimensions": "Support: 2744 x 4273 x 61 mm", "reference": "T07501", "title": "Break Point", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/banner-break-point-t07501", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07501_8.jpg", "artist": "Fiona Banner", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1966", "artistbio": "\n English sculptor and conceptual artist.

Banner came to prominence with her \u2018wordscapes', large text works that recount the plots of feature films or other events. The \u2018wordscapes' led to the publication in 1997 of The Nam, 1,000 pages of continuous text describing the Vietnam war movies Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Hamburger Hill and The Deer Hunter. This unreadable text points to the excess of violence in such films, the numbing of critical faculties, as well as the mythologising and fictionalising framing devices used to interpret historical events. Towards the end of the 1990s she became interested in the implications of punctuation signs, dwelling on their qualities as abstract marks that give structure to text. By selecting a variety of fonts, enlarging the full stop signs to 1,800 pt, and rendering them three-dimensionally, Banner created strangely dramatic objects, simple signs disguised as Minimalist sculpture. These were displayed together in Polystyrene Full Stops: Slipstream, Nuptial, Palatino, Times, Gill Sans Condensed, New Century Schoolbook (1998\u20139; Los Angeles, CA, 1301PE). The use of weightless polystyrene, which commonly functions as a packing material, points again to the paradox of the physical insignificance and semantic importance of these object\u2013signs.BibliographyPerfect Speed: Six British Artists (exh. cat., essays C.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n A painter based in New York, Currin was first known for his 1989-90 series of pseudo-portraits of young women (head and shoulders) painted in a deadpan manner. Taken from photographs in high school yearbooks, they were characterised by their bland prettiness and seemingly untroubled sweetness. Their blank gaze and the overall emptiness of the image reproduces a terrifying moment of stillness compared by the artist to the deadly cold stare of Damien, protagonist of the film The Omen (1976, director Richard Donner). Subsequent paintings depict caricatured men and women whose over-large eyes, ruddy cheeks and sentimental expressions suggest the world of the cartoon. Women with balloon-like breasts and slender bearded men act out the traditional fantasies of the white American male as expressed in the kitsch culture of pornography, advertising and magazine photographs. The excessive sickliness of these images contrasts with the emptiness of the personalities portrayed, producing a psychologically unsettling effect. More recently Currin has turned to the mood and atmosphere of Flemish and Italian Renaissance paintings as the vehicle for his exploration of the foundation of cultural clich\u00e9s and the desires behind them.\n\nHoneymoon Nude belongs to this latter phase. An art-historical hybrid with her classical body, Botticelli hands and twentieth century face - wide-eyed and open-mouthed in the manner of a pornographer's accomplice - she represents an image of heterosexual male desire, a gorgeous female object to be appropriated and possessed. That she is no more than an image has been made clear by the inadequate wisps of hair on the top of her head - floating against the black ground they belie the seeming realistic solidity of her face and body. Most of Currin's women are blonde; most resemble him, and this is no exception. For Currin the act of painting is a means of claiming ownership for what he creates, dependent on embracing his desire as 'something good'. To portray his desire as partly an extension (or possible mirror) of himself - particularly through the most personal and expressive part of a person, the face - could be seen as a means of taking responsibility for the narcissistic aspects of desire. Rather than differentiating the object of his desire as separate and other, through resemblance Currin infers that he and his object are one and the same. Thus he produces a form of self-portrait.\n\n The subject of a painting is always the author, the artist. You can only make an illusion that it's about something other than that. I think that's what the function of representation is: to give a painting the illusion of a subject \u2026 I would rather that my work turn into a clich\u00e9 than be a kind of artfully dodged, ironic critique. I'd rather that my work be truly a clich\u00e9 than a critique of clich\u00e9s. Ultimately, I think that what I do is find a clich\u00e9 and try to believe in it, try to get to where I don't laugh at it.

He completed a BFA at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh (1984) and an MFA at Yale University (1986). In his paintings of single or coupled figures Currin confronts his own desires and subjectivity, however unsophisticated, as well as a certain view of painting as a medium that in the late 20th century has become inherently kitsch. The wilfully degraded references to traditions from high culture are magnified by his custom of working to the small dimensions of conventional easel paintings. His subjects take the form of bland, caricatured portraits that picture a strange, repressed sexual longing; his women idealised in a manner that combines classical gravity and grace with crude pin-up voluptuousness, his males emasculated, their most striking quality a foppish femininity reflected from their female companions. Although flaunting bad taste, his works are given depth by his broadly handled painterly technique, often recalling that of French painters such as Edouard Manet and Camille Corot: the typically large-breasted Big Lady (1993; Rivendell Col., on permanent loan to Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, Bard Col., Cent. Cur. Stud.), recalls the tonal palette and handling of the latter. Other works make similarly uncomplicated references; Portrait (1993; Paris, R. Vifian Priv. Col.) evokes El Greco, whilst the overtly saccharine Entertaining with Mr. Acker Bilk (1995; Seattle, Donald Young Gal.) suggests the Rococo gaiety of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard. He describes his subtle stylistic plundering as mannerist, rather than ironic, distancing his works from the socio-political involvement of many of his contemporaries.\nBibliographyJohn Currin: Works 1989\u20131995 (exh. cat., essays K.

Lanyon's work is central to any assessment of St Ives painting, since he experienced at first hand the invigorating influence of Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo, when they moved to St Ives in 1939.

Visual and structural information concerning this Cornish fishing harbour was combined with figurative suggestion in the final painting. \nLanyon talked about exploring vertiginous edges such as \u2018the junction of sea and cliff, wind and cliff, the human body and places', and in 1959 began gliding. The tactile surfaces and compact, enclosed forms of his work of the early 1950s began to expand into a new flowing style on an increased scale, encouraged by his knowledge of Abstract Expressionism. \nLanyon's prints related to his paintings and their themes. He produced linocuts, monotypes, etchings and lithographs. Ground Wind (lithograph, 1961; see 1981 exh. cat., no. 75), based on his gliding experiences, depicts the merging land, sea and sky; by drawing the image directly on to the lithographic stone, Lanyon achieved a freer treatment of the subject.\nLanyon's last works often drew inspiration from his gliding, but he also referred to architectural forms. He became involved with mural designs. In addition he produced painted junk-studded reliefs, which influenced his final oil paintings.

He has been well-known for many years as a music-hall entertainer; his performances include Jarry's \u2018Ubu Roi\u2019 at the Royal Court, Beckett's \u2018Krapp's Last Tape\u2019 at Greenwich Theatre and Riverside Studios, and the BBC and Roundhouse productions of \u2018Waiting for Godot\u2019. Extensive biographical notes on Max Wall are given in the catalogue of Maggi Hambling's Max Wall exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (cited above) pp.32\u20133.\n\nThe following information is based on a conversation with the artist on 14 April 1986.\n\nMaggi Hambling first saw Max Wall when he was performing as Ubu in Jarry's \u2018Ubu Roi\u2019 at the Royal Court Theatre in 1966. In spring 1981, towards the end of her appointment as first Artist in Residence at the National Gallery, she saw him in his one man show, \u2018Aspects of Max Wall\u2019 at the nearby Garrick Theatre. After seeing the show for a second time, again moved by his performance, Maggi Hambling wrote to Max Wall asking him if he would sit for a portrait. This was the first time that she had approached a sitter in this way. In the catalogue of her Max Wall exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (cited above), p.10, Maggi Hambling wrote:\n\n\nHe has the true face of the sad clown, and possesses that power I can only call magical to make one laugh and cry at the same moment. My first painting in oils at the age of fourteen was of a clown, and at various times over the years I have attempted this subject. The contradictory aspects of the clown's nature fascinate me. I believe that the art of the clown in demonstrating to us the absurdities of life is a very necessary part of life.\n\n\n\u2018Max Wall and his Image\u2019 is Maggi Hambling's first painting of Max Wall. It was painted in five sittings in the spring of 1981. The setting is the artist's studio in Tennyson Street in South London. Maggi Hambling set the stage by hanging up a black curtain and placing stools on drawing boards, themselves raised on crates. When setting up this precarious arrangement Maggi Hambling did not realise that Max Wall had been an acrobat during his early career. To decide on the pose she made two quick working drawings. They are reproduced in the catalogue of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition (cited above), p.11.\n\nThe artist borrowed a large photograph of Max Wall's celebrated character Professor Wallofski and pinned it to the wall of her studio, beside the black curtain, before his first visit. In T03542 the shadow of Wallofski hovers behind his right shoulder. This is the image that is most generally associated with the actor. During sittings Max Wall referred to it as \u2018the monster\u2019; he felt that he was followed everywhere by Wallofski. The artist feels that the portrait shows him \u2018as he is, my response to him, as I saw him\u2019. The Wallofski section of the painting was repainted several times, including three different versions of the shadow walking from behind the curtain. The final version has been turned around and simplified almost to a silhouette.\n\nThe artist asked Max Wall to wear for the sittings the costume he had worn during the first half of his one man show, the part of the performance that had particularly moved her.\n\nThe first ovoid shape to appear in the painting was the door handle, which from a particular angle appeared to resemble an egg. During a rest between sittings Max Wall picked up a white alabaster egg and demonstrated one of his conjuring tricks to the artist. He later gave Maggi Hambling a black glass egg as a present. A white and black egg can be seen flying in the picture space in the Tate's painting.\n\nThe moon, in the top left hand corner, is a doubly significant reference to night time. Max Wall's working life as an actor takes place mostly in the evenings. Also Maggi Hambling fetched the actor for sittings at lunchtimes, and contrary to her normal practice, the sitting and conversations went on well into the night.\n\nMax Wall smoked continuously between sittings and his butts and St Moritz cigarette packet appear in the foreground of the painting. Most of the Tate's picture is painted from life, directly representing Max Wall as he appeared on the stage Maggi Hambling had arranged, with the studio door beyond. Only the part of the painting to the left and immediately behind the sitter (the wall colour, the eggs, the moon and the final image of Wallofski) come from the imagination. Maggi Hambling points out that for her \u2018a portrait is first and foremost a painting and secondarily a portrait\u2019.\n\nStarting with the Tate's picture Max Wall became the subject of Maggi Hambling's work for nearly two years. The catalogue of her Max Wall exhibition lists thirty-eight works (fifteen of them canvases) representing him with subjects connected with him. Almost all are reproduced; they include \u2018Max's Egg\u2019 1982, in which one of the items seen on the crowded mantelpiece of Maggi Hambling's studio is a photograph of the Tate's painting.\n\nThis entry has been approved by the artist.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1981", "dimensions": "Support: 1677 x 1219 mm", "reference": "T03542", "title": "Max Wall and his Image", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hambling-max-wall-and-his-image-t03542", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03542_8.jpg", "artist": "Maggi Hambling", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1945", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

In 1969 she received a Boise Travel Award to New York. Hambling's reputation was formed by a major series of portraits of the celebrated British comedian Max Wall, produced while she was the first Artist-in-Residence at the National Gallery, London (1980\u201381), and exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in 1983. The vivid observation in numerous paintings and charcoal sketches encapsulated her direct and committed engagement with her subject, interpreted in dynamic and bravura impressions. In the mid 1980s she turned to landscape painting, made in her native Suffolk. Her studies of dawn in the Orwell Estuary recall the luminous visions of the 19th-century English masters J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. In works from the early 1990s a violent symbolism disturbs dreamlike compositions; whirlpools of primal colour revolve around the image of a fractured moon in elegies of spectral radiance. Hambling not only worked from life and the model but also drew on memory and her subconscious imagination to escape the limits of documentary realism.\nBibliographyMaggi Hambling: Paintings, Drawings and Watercolours (exh. cat. by M.

He attended Lincoln School of Art from 1873 to 1878. He studied from 1879 to 1882 with Charles Verlat at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp, as did other future Newlyn school painters such as Fred Hall (1860\u20131948), Thomas Cooper Gotch and Norman Garstin. After a period in Venice (1882\u20134) Bramley joined the artists' colony in Newlyn, Cornwall, where he stayed until 1895. The Newlyn school became known for its Cornish genre scenes and plein-air approach, but Domino (1886; Cork, Crawford Mun. A.G.) typifies Bramley's initial interest in interiors with varied natural and artificial light effects, as well as his involvement with tonal harmonies and the surface qualities of the square brush.\nLike Garstin and Hall, Bramley tried to balance his own aesthetic concerns with an emotional and narrative content that would appeal to the general public. A Hopeless Dawn (1888; London, Tate; see England, fig. 21) successfully combined formal strengths with the dramatic and emotional power that Domino lacked. It was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest trustees and established Bramley's reputation. In the early 1890s his paint became brighter, thicker and looser. His subject-range narrowed to portraits, rural genre paintings \u2013 often symbolic and quiet scenes of the elderly reflecting on their past. Bramley regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1884 to 1912. He was made an ARA in 1894 and an RA in 1911. He settled in Grasmere, Westmorland (now Cumbria), in 1900.\nBibliographyC.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n When The Derby Day was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858, it proved so popular that a rail had to be put up to keep back the crowds. It presents a panorama of modern Victorian life, a previously unknown genre which Frith largely created in his earlier work, Life at the Seaside, Ramsgate Sands of 1854 (Royal Collection). Frith was a firm believer in the spurious sciences of phrenology and social type, which considered people's characters and social origins were visible in their physical features. Each character in Frith's picture is depicted to conform to these stereotypes, notably in the range of criminal and low-life types present (see Cowling 1989, Ch.2).\n\nOn the basis of an initial sketch, which he made after a visit to Epsom in 1856, Frith was commissioned by Jacob Bell, a chemist and amateur artist, to paint a large 5-6 foot canvas for \u00a31,500. He worked on the project for fifteen months, producing two large sketches in addition to the finished work. He brought the composition together with the aid of drawings and sketches, hiring models to pose for all the main figures. He also commissioned the photographer Robert Howlett to 'photograph for him from the roof of a cab as many queer groups of figures as he could' (Journal of the Photographic Society, 15 January 1863). He asked a real jockey called Bundy to pose on a hobbyhorse in his studio for the riders on the right of the picture, and also hired an acrobat and his son, whom he saw performing in a pantomime in Drury Lane. For the remaining figures he called on family and friends, as well as a string of young women sent by Jacob Bell.\n\nDespite a remarkable feat of organisation, the picture remains fairly static, and the figures are more interesting when examined individually. There are three main incidents taking place in the picture. On the far left, next to the Reform Club's private tent, a group of men in top hats focus on the thimble-rigger with his table, inviting the audience to participate in the game. The man taking a note from his pocket is the trickster's accomplice. He is tempting the rustic-looking man in a smock, whose wife is trying to restrain him. On the right of this group, another man, with his hands in his pockets, has had his gold watch stolen by the man behind. In the centre of the picture we see the acrobat and his son, who looks longingly over at a sumptuous picnic being laid out by a footman. Behind them are carriages filled with race-goers, including a courtesan on the far right, who is the kept mistress of the foppish-looking character leaning against the carriage. The courtesan is balanced on the far left of the picture by the woman in a dark riding habit, one of a number of high-class prostitutes who daily paraded on horseback in Hyde Park.\n\nFurther reading:Aubrey Noakes, William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter, London 1978, pp.59-69, reproduced in colour, pl.5.Mary Cowling, The Artist as Anthropologist: The Representation of Type and Character in Victorian Art, Cambridge 1989, Ch.2Tate Gallery: An Illustrated Companion, London 1989, p.85, reproduced in colour\n\nFrances FowleNovember 2000Revised by Robert Upstone August 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1856\u20138", "dimensions": "Support: 1016 x 2235 mm", "reference": "N00615", "title": "The Derby Day", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/frith-the-derby-day-n00615", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N00/N00615_8.jpg", "artist": "William Powell Frith", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1819\u20131909", "artistbio": "\n English painter. The few pictures that made Frith's reputation are of contemporary subjects. These started, tentatively, with a picture of a servant girl (c. 1853), which was engraved with the saleable title of Sherry Sir? Frith produced his first ambitious modern-life subject: Life at the Seaside (or Ramsgate Sands, exh. RA 1854; London, Buckingham Pal., Royal Col.).. Its purchase by Queen Victoria encouraged Frith to produce the equally popular Derby Day (exh. RA 1858; London, Tate) and the Railway Station (1862; Egham, U. London, Royal Holloway &amp; Bedford New Coll.). Frith's self-confessed interest in the city crowd, its physiognomy and expression inspired both subjects. His aptitude for the dramatic grouping of large numbers of people into coherent units, his eye for the anecdotal and his unabashed inclination to appeal to sentiment are all fully exploited and enhanced by his precise technique.\nAlthough Frith's Salon d'Or, Homburg (Providence, RI Sch. Des., Mus. A.), a sensation-seeking view of the notorious gambling hall at Homburg, proved a success at the Royal Academy of 1871, the composition is comparatively stiff, and his touch and characterisation less precise. These faults are increasingly evident in later works.\nFrith retired as an RA in 1890 but continued to exhibit until 1902. His greatest success in later life came from his books, Autobiography and Reminiscences (1887) and Further Reminiscences (1888), in which he showed himself as much a literary as an artistic raconteur, and in which he assessed his career with winning modesty and irony.\nBibliographyLondon, V&amp;A [corr.]MARY COWLING\n ", "acquisition": "Bequeathed by Jacob Bell 1859"},

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Stern is a large, nearly square-format painting showing a face seen in profile, lying down. Enlarged to giant proportions, and filling almost the entire picture frame, the face is a deathly white, unrelieved by the warmth of any colour that might suggest life. The eyes are closed, as though the subject is sleeping, but her black lips and black lines suggesting a rope around her neck appear to confirm that the subject is dead. Stern is in fact a death portrait, named after the German periodical which first printed the shocking photograph of the corpse of Ulrike Meinhof, the Red Army Faction terrorist who either committed suicide or was murdered in her Stammheim prison cell in May 1976. The artist borrowed the source \u2013 a newsmagazine photograph \u2013 from the German artist Gerhard Richter (born 1932), who had used the image as the basis for three of the fifteen paintings that make up his suite entitled October 18, 1977 1988 (Museum of Modern Art, New York) commemorating the deaths of all four Red Army Faction members. Ulrike Meinhof was found hanged with a strip of towel, leaving black burn-marks on her neck that Dumas transformed into the suggestion of a black rope above the white shroud. \n\nStern is one of a group of paintings exhibited under the title The Second Coming at Frith Street Gallery, London (November \u2013 December 2004), many of which depict figures lying prone in ambiguous states of sleep, death or sexual ecstasy. Three similarly scaled large canvases showed close-ups of corpses\u2019 faces: Stern, Lucy (T12312) and Alpha (illustrated hanging together in Marlene Dumas: The Second Coming, [p.41]). Like Stern, Lucy is based on a previous painting \u2013 The Burial of St Lucy created by Michelangelo Caravaggio (1571\u20131610) in 1608. Dumas derives most of her paintings from second-hand sources, using photographs from magazines and newspapers, or polaroids she has taken herself. Her images frequently reproduce the cropping, blurring and flattening effects of the medium of photography. Stern reflects the artist\u2019s recent concern with significant, often political, events. Dumas combines the imagery of popular culture and recent news with the religious and biblical subjects typical to old master paintings, such as those referred to by the title of her 1996 series entitled Magdalena\n(T07201\u2013T07206). She has commented:\n\n\nIdentifying the subject is not the key to the content. To understand what the work means is to look at the relationship between the technological source material (i.e. photographic models) and the metaphysical imagination (of the artist), it\u2019s associative rather than descriptive, it\u2019s about the physical qualities of the actual works coming together in the cultural space of the exhibition.\n\n(Quoted in press release for The Second Coming, http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/dumas_04.html\n\n, accessed 29 September 2008.)\n\n\t\n\nAs her words indicate, Dumas is primarily interested in the language, techniques and ethics of representation. Stern and Lucy each depict a woman\u2019s face in extreme close-up, filling almost the entire canvas. In both images, the face is upturned, the eyes closed and mouth open, poses which are suggestive of ecstatic sexual charge. As so often in Dumas\u2019s work, the artist explores the desire to look and visually consume, while encouraging us simultaneously to remain aware of the implications of such imbalanced access. The heightened expressions of the artist\u2019s subjects are, in fact, frozen and taught, and the deathly pallor of each is corroborated by small yet significant details which point to their lifeless states: the black lines on the woman\u2019s neck in Stern and the gash at the throat of Lucy. In The Second Coming, the juxtaposition of these portraits with a smaller painting of a dead woman\u2019s face, entitled From Ophelia to Medusa, 2004 (illustrated in Marlene Dumas: The Second Coming, [p.21]), makes the viewer\u2019s position as consuming voyeur more explicit. The subject of From Ophelia to Medusa has open eyes and a mouth full of teeth, evoking the horror of death as well as its vulnerability and passivity. In the introduction to the catalogue of The Second Coming, Dumas notes that \u2018Death can\u2019t be seen, it has to be touched. Images don\u2019t care. Images do not discriminate between sleep and death. We do. We have to.\u2019 ([p.2.]) She has also commented:\n\n\nLooking at images does not lead us to the truth.\n\nIt leads us into temptation.\n\nIt\u2019s not that a medium dies.\n\nIt\u2019s that all media have become suspect.\n\nIt\u2019s not the artists\u2019 subject matter that\u2019s under fire,\t\n\nbut their motivation that\u2019s on trial.\n\nNow that we know that images can mean whatever,\n\nwhoever wants them to mean, we don\u2019t trust anybody anymore, \n\nespecially ourselves.\n\n(Quoted in Gianni Romano, Marlene Dumas: Suspect, exhibition catalogue, Fondazione Bevilacqua la Masa, Venice 2003, p.35.)\n\n\nFurther reading:\nMarlene Dumas: The Second Coming, exhibition catalogue, Frith Street Gallery, London 2004, reproduced [p.33].\nAdrian Searle, \u2018Fatal Attraction\u2019, The Guardian, 23 November 2004, http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2004/nov/23/1\n\n, accessed 29 September 2008.\nMarlene Dumas: Broken White, exhibition catalogue, Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo 2007, reproduced pp.78 and 94.\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nSeptember 2008\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "2004", "dimensions": "Support: 1101 x 1302 x 24 mm", "reference": "T12312", "title": "Stern", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dumas-stern-t12312", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12312_8.jpg", "artist": "Marlene Dumas", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1953", "artistbio": "\n Marlene Dumas born 1953Marlene Dumas was born in Cape Town, South Africa.

He championed them vociferously. Unfortunately the marbles encouraged Haydon's injudicious preference for working on a vast scale. Christ's Entry took six years, during which Haydon refused other work and was effectively without income. Their lack of compositional integration was exacerbated by the long time span and by an eye defect that enabled Haydon to see only one part of a canvas at a time. Nevertheless both pictures show him at his best as a history painter; they were much admired by contemporaries and possess undeniable grandeur.\nHaydon's exclusive concentration on these paintings put him heavily into debt, and in 1823 he suffered the first of a series of bankruptcies and imprisonments. His disputes with the Academy had alienated him from his colleagues and his journalistic activities had made him many enemies. \nHis diary and autobiography are major documents in English Romanticism, indispensable for the study of the period.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The Italian dancer Giovanna Francesca Antonio Guiseppe Zanerini was born in Venice and took her mother's name, Baccelli, as her stage name. She was a principal ballerina in London at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, where she first appeared in 1774. She reached the peak of her acclaimed career during the 1780-1 season when she appeared with Gaetan Vestris and his son Auguste in several important ballets devised by Noverre. As one reviewer (quoted in Whitley, p.188) noted, she appears in this portrait in the costume, make-up and pose from a ballet she danced that season, Les Amans Surpris: 'the artist was not only obliged to vivify and embellish; but, if he would be thought to copy the original, to lay on his colouring thickly. In this he has succeeded, for the face of this admirable dancer is evidently paint-painted'. Baccelli also danced with great success in Venice in 1783-4, and at the Paris Op\u00e9ra as late as 1788. Gainsborough was well-acquainted with many theatre people, including Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the famous dramatist and part-owner of the King's Theatre. \n\nBaccelli was equally known as the last and most enduring mistress of John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset (1745-99). When Baccelli's portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1782, Gainsborough's portrait of the Duke (collection Lord Sackville) was withdrawn, presumably for reasons of decorum. The Duke patronised Gainsborough's great rival Joshua Reynolds, who painted Baccelli in 1783 (collection Lord Sackville). The Duke, a handsome, extravagant man with a string of famous mistresses, had set up Baccelli in a suite of rooms at Knole by October 1779. Baccelli accompanied him to Paris in 1783 when he was appointed Ambassador to France. They entertained lavishly, patronising the Paris Op\u00e9ra, and were admitted to the friendship of Queen Marie-Antoinette. Horace Walpole records that when the Duke was awarded the Order of the Garter in 1788, Baccelli danced at the Op\u00e9ra wearing the blue Garter ribbon around her head. As the events of the French Revolution unfolded, the pair returned to Knole, where Baccelli remained until their amicable parting in 1789. She left a son behind. She subsequently developed close friendships with Henry Herbert, 10th Earl of Pembroke, and Mr James Carey, with whom she remained until her death in 1801. \n\nThis lively portrait, which was at Knole until 1890, is an excellent example of Gainsborough's mature style, which is distinguished by small, quick, light brushstrokes. Most striking is the artist's successful rendering of movement. Baccelli was by accounts more charming than beautiful, and Gainsborough's portrait captures this aspect of her character perfectly. A contemporary newspaper critic said the portrait was 'as the Original, light airy and elegant' (quoted in Einberg, p.14). A receipt from Gainsborough is still preserved at Knole: 'Recd. of His Grace the Duke of Dorset one hundred guineas in full for the two 3/4 Portraits of his Grace, one full length of Madlle Baccelli, two Landskips and one sketch of Begger Boy and Girl 63105. June 15 1784/ Tho. Gainsborough'. \n\nA small finished oil sketch for this painting is at Russborough. It has no tambourine in the lower left corner and there are other slight compositional variations. Baccelli was also painted by Ozias Humphrey (exhibited 1780, untraced), John Graham (exhibited 1784, untraced), and Gainsborough Dupont (c.1795, Royal Collection); a nude sculpture by Locatelli is at Knole. \n\nFurther reading:William T.

He was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to a London silversmith, and was taught by Hubert Gravelot, a French book-illustrator. By 1745 he had established his own studio in London. He married Margaret Burr in 1746, and by 1748 had taken\nup residence in Suffolk. He moved to Ipswich in 1752, and settled at Bath as a portraitist in 1759. He took as an apprentice his nephew, Gainsborough Dupont (1754-97) in 1772. There are no records of any other pupils or assistants. In 1774, established\nas a fashionable portrait painter, he moved to London, living at Schomberg House, Pall Mall. Despite his great success as a portraitist, he always maintained that he preferred painting landscapes. He wrote to a friend, William Jackson: 'I'm sick of\nPortraits and wish very much to take my Viol da Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village, where I can paint Landskips and enjoy the fag End of life in quietness and ease' (in Woodall, p.115, no.56).Gainsborough exhibited at the Society of Artists\nfrom 1761 to 1769, and became a foundation member of the Royal Academy in 1768. He first exhibited there the following year, but in 1773 quarrelled with the Academy over the hanging of his pictures, and did not exhibit there again until 1777. In 1784 he\nagain quarrelled with them over the same subject, and never again exhibited at the Academy, instead organising a series of annual exhibitions in his studio at Schomberg House.He received commissions from the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland in 1777,\nand from the King and Queen in 1781. He toured the West Country with Gainsborough Dupont in about 1782, and visited the Lake District with Samuel Kilderbee in 1783. Gainsborough died in London after a reconciliation with his great rival Sir Joshua\nReynolds, who eulogised him at the Royal Academy, commenting that 'whatever he attempted he carried to a high degree of excellence' (R. Wark, ed., Sir Joshua Reynolds: Discourses on Art, New Haven and London 1975, p.254). He is buried in\nKew Churchyard. A posthumous sale of his pictures and drawings was held at Schomberg House in 1789.

His early work made deliberate reference to the American artists he most admired, such as Donald Judd, Jasper Johns and Robert Morris. Although he was particularly affected by Minimalism and used ordinary household materials in his sculptures, he played against the logic of his sources; in Four Identical Boxes with Lids Reversed (painted blockboard, 1969; London, Tate), for example, he created a curious progression by slicing into four identical boxes at different angles and then exchanging their halves.\nCraig-Martin continued working in various forms, always maintaining an elegant restraint and conceptual clarity. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and luridly vivid colour schemes in unexpected (and at times apparently arbitrary) combinations applied both to works on canvas, such as Knowing (1996; London, Tate) and to increasingly complex installations of wall paintings. For his one-man exhibition at the Kunstverein Hannover in 1998, Craig-Martin transformed the galleries into a series of environments of luscious colour, onto which he painted his characteristic motifs of tables, chairs and stepladders and also hung paintings, reliefs and wall-mounted sculptures. \nBibliographyMichael Craig-Martin: Prints (exh. cat., essay by R.

Over the next three years they spent winters in Lugano,\nSwitzerland, then divided their time between London and Cumberland. In 1931, Nicholson's relationship with the sculptor Barbara Hepworth resulted in the breakdown of his marriage to Winifred. He and Hepworth married in 1938 and divorced in 1951.\nNicholson lived in London from 1932 to 1939, making several trips to Paris in 1932-3, visiting the studios of Picasso, Braque, Arp, Brancusi and Mondrian. From 1939 to 1958 he lived and worked in Cornwall, before moving to Switzerland. He returned to\nLondon in 1974.Nicholson's earliest paintings were still lifes influenced by those of his father. In the 1920s he began painting figurative and abstract works inspired by Post Impressionism and Cubism. He produced his first geometric and abstract\nreliefs in 1933. He first exhibited in 1919, at the Grosvenor Gallery and Grafton Galleries. His first one-man show was held at the Twenty-one Gallery, London in 1924. From 1924 to 1935 he was a member of the Seven and Five Society, and in 1933 he\njoined Unit One, founded by Paul Nash. In 1937 Nicholson, Naum Gabo and the architect Leslie Martin edited Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art. Circle identified Nicholson with a group of like-minded artists and architects\nwho wanted to apply 'constructivist' principles to public and private art, advocating mathematical precision, clean lines and an absence of ornament. In 1952 Nicholson won first prize at the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh. He was awarded the\nfirst Guggenheim International painting prize in 1956, and the international prize for painting at the Sao Paulo Bienal in 1957. He received the Order of Merit in 1968.

Helped by wide international exposure in British Council tours during\nthe 1940s and 1950s and by the championing of the writer Herbert Read, Nicholson's work came to be seen, with Henry Moore's, as the quintessence of British modernism.

He was the most important animal painter of his generation. Many of his dynamic compositions depict horses, dogs or wild animals in agitated emotional states, the sense of movement being reinforced by vigorous brushwork and strong colours. With their sweeping landscapes and dramatic skies, his canvases epitomise Romanticism. Not content to excel merely as an animal painter, Ward also produced portraits, landscapes and genre and history paintings of varying quality. \nWhile the impact of Rubens on Ward's development is well documented and was long lasting, this traditional division of Ward's career oversimplifies the diverse influences, ranging from Classical art to Old Masters and contemporary painters, that shaped his highly eclectic style.\nShortly before 1810 Ward began painting portraits of thoroughbreds and blood horses. Of special note are Napoleon's charger Marengo and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington's Copenhagen (both 1824; Alnwick Castle, Northumb.). \nIn the 1810s and early 1820s Ward produced a number of major paintings. Gordale Scar (?1812\u201314; London, Tate), ranks as one of his most ambitious compositions. The dark brooding landscape, dominated in the right foreground by a white aboriginal bull and populated with a vast array of cattle and deer, is one of the finest visualisations of the Sublime, an aesthetic then enjoying widespread currency.\nHe became increasingly disillusioned with the art world. Many works from the last several decades of Ward's life have religious themes or contain overt moral messages. Ward wrote theological tracts and poetry. A stroke in 1855 ended his artistic career.\nBibliographyJ. Frankau: William Ward, A.R.A., James Ward, R.A. (London, 1904)C. R. Grundy: James Ward, R.A.: His Life and Works (London, 1909)D.

It's most probable that I felt it was finished in 1944, but I continued to work on it into 1945 without bothering to add the extra date. I remember Peter Watson urging me to hurry up and deliver it to the block makers.\n\nIn a letter to the compiler postmarked 26 April 1986, Craxton wrote:\n\nPreparatory drawings for \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019 as far as I know don't exist. The place that is at the back of it existed and that is the Mill, Alderholt [Dorset], [near] Fordingbridge [Hampshire] - the footbridge over the stream and the main bridge etc. I can't explain the floppy hat! nor the dead tree shaped like a moon cow's horns coming out of the bush nor the young and alive tree coming out of another. If the painting has mystery and enigma then that is what I wanted it to have. Incidentally at that time Lucian [Freud] and I were allowed to attend the Surrealist dinners once a week at the Casa Pep\u00e9 with Mesens, Robert Melville and all. Lucian painted a marvellous self portrait of himself holding a feather at about the same time which may have a faint connection with \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019.\n\nThe Freud painting is \u2018Man with a Feather (Self Portrait)\u2019 1943 (oil on canvas 30 \u00d7 20 inches, repr. Lawrence Gowing, Lucian Freud 1982, p.18). There is a close connection between \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019 and Craxton's \u2018Reaper with a Mushroom\u2019 1944\u20135 (cont\u00e9 crayon on blue paper, 17 \u00d7 24 inches, repr. in catalogue of Craxton's 1967 Whitechapel Gallery retrospective, cited above). In both works a single figure wearing a hat with a wide, curved brim stands in front of a tree, the trunk of which culminates at the top in a spike, and extends a mushroom in one hand. Like \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019, the drawing \u2018Painter's Landscape\u2019 1944 (repr. in catalogue of same Whitechapel exhibition) gives prominence to a crescent moon (the form of which is echoed by the sickle held by the reaper in \u2018Reaper with a Mushroom\u2019), and also to spiked trees. The horned form in the centre of \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019 is echoed by the horns of the bull which enters at the left of the picture in \u2018Painter's Landscape\u2019 (in the middle distance of \u2018Reaper with a Mushroom\u2019 prances a fierce animal of indeterminate species). Other works reproduced in 1945 in the same article as \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019 were Craxton's \u2018Welsh Farmyard\u2019 1944, in which the twin prongs of the implement held by the single figure echo the horns in \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019; Graham Sutherland's \u2018Horned Forms\u2019 1944 (Tate Gallery, T00834); and Sutherland's \u2018The Intruding Bull\u2019 1944. In his interview with Gerard Hastings in the catalogue of John Craxton, An Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings 1908\u20131985, Christopher Hull Gallery, June\u2013July 1985, Craxton stated:\n\nPeter Watson introduced me to Sutherland, whom I already admired. When he saw my picture \u2018Poet in Landscape\u2019 (1941) in Watson's flat he said \u2018I wish I had been able to paint something like that when I was your age\u2019. I went to Pembrokeshire with him for the first time in 1943 and learnt a lot.\n\nIn The Poet's Eye 1944, an anthology chosen by Geoffrey Grigson with sixteen lithographs by Craxton, the images facing pp.38 and 42 are reminiscent in several ways of \u2018Dark Landscape\u2019. Both are printed in various blues and black, as is the image facing p.31, which also includes a crescent moon in white. Craxton points out (letter postmarked 16 June 1986) that the image facing p.102, which is printed in greens and black, \u2018is the same landscape from a different view over the watermeadows\u2019 and that the black and white image on p.9, which relates to the right hand form in T03837, \u2018is growling bush with sapling\u2019.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on board", "date": "1944\u20135", "dimensions": "Support: 546 x 705 x 4 mm", "reference": "T03837", "title": "Dark Landscape", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/craxton-dark-landscape-t03837", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03837_8.jpg", "artist": "John Craxton", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1922\u20132009", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

Through Watson he met with other artists associated with Neo-romanticism and like many of his generation he fell heavily under the influence of Graham Sutherland and Samuel Palmer, as seen in Poet in a Landscape (1941; London, Christopher Hull Gal.). By 1943, in such works as Welsh Estuary Foreshore (Edinburgh, N.G. Mod. A.), a marked departure could be recognized. Its reference to the work of Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir\u00f3 placed him in a more European context. After World War II he travelled around the Mediterranean, finally settling in Crete in 1960, where he continued to develop his Romantic pastoral themes. The influence of William Blake gave way to that of Cubism, and he also became interested in Byzantine art. His paintings of Cretan life, such as Vokos II (1984; London, Christopher Hull Gal., see exh. cat., no. 3), still reveal a humanist if not pantheist philosophy.\nBibliographyA Paradise Lost: The Neo-Romantic Imagination in Britain, 1935\u201355 (exh. cat., ed.

However, he was not very stimulated by the art he saw there and subsequently preferred not to travel; his taste for domestic life in England is reflected in his painting. He worked in a harsh realist style, applying the paint thickly in vibrant colours, and portraying sometimes ugly and desperate faces. He primarily chose his family as subjects and incorporated all the clutter of urban domestic life in his paintings. It was this concern with social realism that brought Bratby into contact with Jack Smith, Edward Middleditch (b 1923) and Derrick Greaves (b 1927), and these artists became the main exponents of the Kitchen sink school. However, while the Kitchen Sink artists shared a desire to depict the banality of a working-class domestic environment, Bratby's use of colours and his more middle-class surroundings distinguished his style from that of his peers. Bratby taught for two brief periods. In the late 1960s he started a series of portraits of celebrities, including the actress Billie Whitelaw; the series developed into a Hall of Fame during the 1970s. He painted cityscapes on trips abroad in the 1980s but concentrated on self-portraits and portraits of his second wife, in intimate poses and with bright colours and an economy of line.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Ile de France is one of Jean H\u00e9lion\u2019s most important abstract paintings and, at two metres across, it was clearly envisaged as a substantial piece. Typical of his work in the mid-1930s is the disposition of variously sized and coloured planes across a relatively neutral background. For the large scale of Ile de France, as distinct from the small Abstract Composition (T07921), H\u00e9lion introduced an additional blue background plane that occupies part of the upper half of the composition. The effect is to reinforce the sense of implied space, within which the apparently overlapping planes mark out a rhythm. Four of the floating elements enhance this further through a modulated shading that suggests that they are convex forms within this shallow space. This recurrent device related to H\u00e9lion\u2019s interest in sculptural reliefs on ancient architecture (Jean H\u00e9lion, Lettres d\u2019Am\u00e9rique: Correspondance avec Raymond Queneau 1934-1967, Paris 1996, p.81). Closely comparable conjunctions of elements to those in Ile de France are found in various preparatory ink and wash drawings of 1933-5, notable one of those known as Large Volumes, 1935 (Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019art moderne, Paris, reproduced in H\u00e9lion: Dessins 1930-1978, exhibition catalogue, Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019art moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris 1979, p.19). When asked about the title many years later, he explained that Ile de France (referring to the region around Paris) was so named by a friend, the collector Pierre Brugui\u00e8re, \u2018because it could not have been painted elsewhere\u2019 (letter to Tate, 29 October 1965).\n\nIn the 1930s, H\u00e9lion was one of the most prominent abstract artists in Paris. This reputation came about partly through the originality and fertility of his paintings and ideas, and partly through the energy with which he promoted non-figurative art in exhibitions and publications. He helped to found the international group Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation in 1931 with Jean Arp (1886-1966), Auguste Herbin (1882-1960) and others, but withdrew in 1934 objecting to the sacrifice in new membership of quality to quantity. As well as his wide circle of associates in Paris, he had a number of important contacts in Scandinavia, in the United States (with Alexander Calder) and in Britain (especially with Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth). His encouragement is widely credited as the impetus behind Myfamwy Evans founding Axis\n(1935-7), the first British periodical devoted to abstract art. It was through Axis that H\u00e9lion showed Ile de France, and other works, in the pioneering exhibition Abstract and Concrete organised by Nicolete Gray in 1936. There it appeared alongside Mondrian\u2019s Composition B with Red (T07560), Calder\u2019s T with Swallow (T01142), Hepworth\u2019s Three Forms (T00696) and Nicholson\u2019s white reliefs among others. The artistic radicalism of the exhibition ensured some critical interest but financial failure and many works were returned to the artists. H\u00e9lion showed Ile de France in Paris in 1937 before storing with the writer Raymond Queneau through the war years.\n\nAn inveterate writer, H\u00e9lion recorded the progress of many of his works in a studio notebook. The passage written about Ile de France in 1935, reveals his persistent private doubts about the relation between abstract art and reality even as he worked on such a major canvas:\n\n\nThe oppositions are developing.\n\nThe colours are becoming refined, the space more supple, but the more I advance the more evident is the attraction of nature. The space is provisionally, miraculously, filled with light but the volumes want to become complete: objects, bodies. There will soon be the inevitable odd bit of nature, and the entry into a new naturalistic phase. (Journal d\u2019un peintre, 1992, p.56)\n\n\n\nWhile he made no direct allusion to the outside world in his paintings of the mid-1930s, such notebook passages reveal the underpinnings of his abstraction. Thus, although the formal and colour balances \u2013 or \u2018oppositions\u2019 - were crucial, he saw the planes of Ile de France as volumes occupying a lit space. Thirty years later, after a long period of working from the figure (see Nude with Loaves, 1952, T05497), he identified the abstraction from nature quite explicitly: \u2018Ile de France comprises, on the left, an upright abstract figure from my year [19]34, opposed and composed to and with this [diagram] broad figure with \u201cgros volumes\u201d [Large Volumes]\u2019 (letter to Tate, 29 October 1965).\n\nFurther reading:\nJean H\u00e9lion,\nexhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, Liverpool 1990.\nJean H\u00e9lion, Journal d\u2019un peintre I: Carnets 1929-1962, Paris 1992.\nJean H\u00e9lion, exhibition catalogue, Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris 2004.\n\nMatthew Gale\nMarch 2004\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1935", "dimensions": "Support: 1454 x 2000 mm", "reference": "T00766", "title": "Ile de France", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/helion-ile-de-france-t00766", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00766_8.jpg", "artist": "Jean H\u00e9lion", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1904\u20131987", "artistbio": "\n Jean H\u00e9lion born 1904 [- 1987]French abstract and figurative painter, born at Couterne\nin Normandy.

He was one of the few British artists to make a career out of this genre. The Classical or biblical subject-matter of the history works gave Etty the ideal pretext for painting the nude. He did, however, believe that they had a serious purpose and proclaimed that his intention in all his major paintings had been \u2018to paint some great moral on the heart'. \nDuring the 1830s and 1840s Etty generally concentrated on smaller, less ambitious works.

Remarkably, his public recognition and success were achieved in the face of vitriolic censure from a press that accused him of indecency.

In Celia and her Heroes, the fabric designer Celia Birtwell is portrayed against a variety of images including a portrait of Elvis, a painting by Blake and a portrait of David Hockney (whose 1961 etching Myself and My Heroes is slyly alluded to in her own title). Her work then began to include more serious subject-matter, with a number of political paintings such as Count Down to Violence (1964; see 1998 exh. cat., frontispiece), which incorporate multiple images of destruction and aggression.

He trained in London at Camberwell School of Art from 1948 to 1951 and from 1951 to 1954 at the Slade School of Fine Art, where he came under the influence of William Coldstream. His early figurative style adapted a form of planar drawing derived from Alberto Giacometti's work of the 1920s and applied it to a Classical structure, derived from Paul C\u00e9zanne, with an intensity of colour unrivalled by his teachers of the Euston Road School. Musicians (1953; London, Tate) reinterpreted the Impressionist theme of figures in a landscape by combining directly observed elements with a deliberately contrived backdrop painted on the studio wall.\nUglow was consistently concerned with formal relationships within a self-sufficient system, whatever the subject. He graduated colour according to a tonal scale and used drawing to define three-dimensional form and tactile surfaces. The proportions of the images and of the canvas itself are often mathematically derived, as in the Nude from Twelve Regular Vertical Positions from the Eye (1967; U. Liverpool). There is a strong conceptual element in Uglow's work, with each picture regarded as a specific project with clearly defined aims. The end product unambiguously reveals the history of its making by a prolonged and entirely conscious process of analysis and synthesis, combining objectivity with a private and often quirky passion.\nBibliographyEuan Uglow (exh. cat. by M.

It is one of a series of paintings based on the movement of boats in St Ives harbour which, with the associated series entitled Walk Along the Quay, signalled the artist\u2019s development of a form of abstraction derived from his subjective experience of the external world.\n\nIn the late 1940s Frost\u2019s work was affected by two contrasting influences. From 1947 to 1950 he studied at Camberwell School of Art where, under the professorship of William Coldstream, the analytical figuration of the Euston Road School was advocated. However, since 1946 he and his family had been based in St Ives, Cornwall, an established \u2018artist\u2019s colony\u2019 then developing a reputation for modernist practice. There he came into contact with such senior artists as Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth and their younger followers, including Peter Lanyon and John Wells. Through them he became versed in the work and theories of the constructivist tradition which, in St Ives, was becoming associated with a form of abstraction based on landscape sources. He had originally gone to the town on the advice of the painter Adrian Heath, who had encouraged Frost to paint when they met in a German prisoner of war camp during World War Two.[1] At the end of the 1940s and in the early 1950s, Heath\u2019s London studio was the focus for a group of more purely abstract artists, who signalled their allegiance to the development of constructivism with their label \u2018Constructionists\u2019.[2]\nFrost recalled that his knowledge of modernist art, particularly Russian Constructivism, was expanded through his proximity to Heath, who was gathering material for his short history of abstract painting: Abstract Art: Its Origins and Meanings (London 1953).[3]\nBoth of these modernist formations, in St Ives and London, exercised a fundamental influence on Frost that is registered in this work.\n\nThe artist explained that the composition of melon slice forms scissoring their way down the canvas in Green, Black and White Movement was based upon his observation of boats rocking in St Ives harbour but was generated with the use of geometrical formulae, specifically, the Golden Section.[4]\nFormulated by Euclid and named by Leonardo, this is an ideal geometrical proportion, favoured by artists and architects since Antiquity, which is denoted numerically by the ratio 1:1.618; that is to say that the Golden Section of a line is a point that marks 0.618 of its length. Since this proportion had been identified in nature it became associated with the idea of an harmonious relationship with the universe. For this painting, Frost measured certain proportions and joined them by pencil lines drawn on the canvas and strengthened with charcoal. These produced a network, still visible through the thin green paint, some of which provided the straight lines of the main composition. The proportional system allowed for the subdivision of the composition so that a square was established at the base; this overlaps another, similarly determined, at the top of the canvas. The edge of the uppermost \u2018melon-slice\u2019 form falls on a line running from the top left hand corner to the point where the horizontal line, which sub-divides the lower part of the field to form this square and determines the second slice, crosses the right hand edge. Two diagonals, one from that point and another from the Golden Section converge on the mid-point of the left hand side to provide the third and fourth slices. The fifth falls on a line joining two Golden Section points, and the sixth on a line linking the right hand Golden Section and the point on the left edge that separates off the upper square. A line from the equivalent point on the right hand side generates the final segment. Thus the rocking boats follow an uneven zig-zag from the top left hand corner to the bottom left. Frost explained that he used string to determine the straight lines and that the arcs were defined by slackening the string off.[5]\nLearnt from Victor Pasmore, this technique, which echoed the slackening of mooring ropes at high tide, ensured a proportional relationship between the straight lines and their arcs. Proportional divisions defined the rectangular areas on the left-hand side and the prow-forms that occur in various places in the composition. The linear pattern also influenced the areas of differing densities of green in the main field of the painting. This includes a long arc, which is part of a circle the diameter of which is the height of the canvas and which has its centre half way along the white vertical.\n\nThe pattern of lines is augmented by creases in the canvas and related cracking in the paint surface. In particular, when the work was acquired by the Tate Gallery, the canvas had evident folds across the major horizontals indicating that it had been folded into four at sometime in the past. There were other heavy lines and it is possible that it had also been rolled.[6]\nThe effect of this on the condition of the painting was exacerbated by the fact that the canvas appeared to have been impregnated with wax which had become brittle. The artist was able to explain some of its chequered history. He wrote to the gallery:\n\nThe canvas was prepared by me &amp; if I remember correctly I was using rabbit skin glue &amp; a half chalk ground &amp; I completely messed up the ground by making the glue much too strong. In fact it cracked as soon as I had painted the picture &amp; I did another version which was sold to a chap in Cheltenham.[7]\nThis time it was painted on shop canvas, but I never really liked the other version. I did try scrubbing the rest of the canvas in the bath to remove the glue (because in those days I was short of canvas). However, I could not remove the ground at all with hot water or anything, so I decided that in spite of the cracks the 1st\nversion of Green Black &amp; White Movement was permanent.[8]\n\nThe work was generally thinly painted, though one might speculate on whether the translucent quality of the green field was in part the result of Frost\u2019s bath tub scrubbing. It seems likely that the few areas of thicker paint, particularly the more scumbled impasto of some of the boat forms, were painted after this rough treatment. The surface was also scraped and repainted in some places. On acquisition by the Tate it was noted that there had been some retouching towards the top right hand corner and that the stretcher was warped.[9]\n\nIf the artist had wanted to destroy the painting, he soon relented: it was chosen by Ben Nicholson in an exchange of works and exhibited at the end of that year. Frost recalled these events as a crucial turning point in his career:\n\nBen had that diamond painting over his damp patch on the wall at Carbis Bay. I think it was 1926, a very early painting and he swapped it with me for my painting with the boat shapes which the Tate have got now. We shook hands on it. I was very pleased. But Philip James [Director of Visual Art, Arts Council] had been down and I got a letter the next day from old man Brown of the Leicester Galleries and it said \u2018we would like your green and black and white painting, your pink one and your grey one\u2019. He listed the three that Philip James had seen so I had to go round to Ben and say \u2018I\u2019ve had this letter from the Leicester Galleries\u2019. ... Ben said \u2018do you more good to have a show in London\u2019, so we shook hands and he released me from the deal.[10]\n\nThough demonstrably based on geometrical patterns, Green, Black and White Movement also derived from the artist\u2019s experience of a place. Frost confirmed that \u2018the theme was positively the space changes made by the elements on the boats in the harbour [in St Ives]. Though at that time the division of the canvas was geometrical\u2019.[11]\nThe \u2018elements\u2019 of the boats were their rocking hulls, the swaying masts that defined invisible arcs in the air and the taut or slackened ropes tying them to their moorings. In 1954, he published an account of a related, though distinct and later work, Blue Movement 1953 (Vancouver Art Gallery).[12]\nHe wrote:\n\nI have recently completed a \u2018blue movement\u2019 painting. I had spent a number of evenings looking over the harbour at St Ives in Cornwall. Although I had been observing a multiplicity of movement during those evenings, they all evoked a common emotion or mood \u2013 a state of delight in front of nature. On one particular blue twilit evening, I was watching what I can only describe as a synthesis of movement and counter-movement. That is to say the rise and fall of the boats, the space drawing of the mastheads, the opposing movements of the incoming sea and the outblowing off-shore wind. \u2013 all this plus the predominant feel of blue in the evening and the static brown of the foreshore, generated an emotional state which was to find expression in the painting Blue Movement.\n\nIt was characteristic that Frost explained the painting as an attempt to recapture the emotion he felt at a single moment of inspiration. Lawrence Alloway, in the introduction to Nine Abstract Artists, noted the relationship of this \u2018intuitive way of working\u2019 to the work of Wassily Kandinsky, \u2018who thought that emotion in the artist produced an art-work which then produced the same emotion in the observer\u2019.[13]\n\nDespite the artist\u2019s association of each painting with a single moment, Green, Black and White Movement continued an established body of works derived from a similar source. The development of an abstract composition from the forms of a harbour had first appeared following a visit to Mullion Cove, on the Lizard peninsula, with Lanyon in 1949. Frost produced a painting in which the steep cliffs, the view through the harbour and out to sea, and the slackened mooring ropes of the boats form a semi-abstract composition based on geometric proportion.[14]\nIt was, however, the series of works which culminated in Walk Along the Quay, 1950 (estate of Adrian Heath on loan to Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield) which secured the artist\u2019s reputation for abstract work.[15]\nFrost\u2019s account of the painting\u2019s genesis demonstrates its proximity to the Movement\nseries:\n\nWalk Along the Quay came from a true walk, a regular morning stroll and the constant movement always ... intrigued me ... Things were happening to my right and beneath \u2013 my feet felt and saw all the shapes of boats tied up and either preparing to go out or unloading. The strange feeling of looking on top of boats at high tide and at the same boats tied up and resting on their support posts when the tide\u2019s out ... Low water gives static shape, more smell, more detail of ropes, huge floats etc., high water gives in addition to colour an ever-changing form with a never-known movement, or always something new \u2013 reflection, colour, movement, nothing static or fixed ... So after all this I had no problem in finding out how to paint Walk Along the Quay ... I managed to paint up the canvas or along the canvas, like I walked along the quay, in fact I just walked up the canvas with paint.[16]\n\nOne might find even more representational elements in Green, Black and White Movement, in which the angle of the boat forms creates a sense of rocking motion and the lines coming from their ends suggest their mooring ropes. The translucent green alludes to the seawater and this was noticed by Patrick Heron who saw in the subject matter a modernist treatment of pictorial space. \u2018Even without colour\u2019, he wrote, \u2018one feels the water surface (which now admits the eye deep down into submarine gloom, and now rebuts it, keeping it at\nthe surface) implied throughout the surface of this picture. All the shapes stop the eye, as a bat stops a ball, cleanly and finally at a given depth in the imagined space in the painting.\u2019[17]\n\nHeron\u2019s critique demonstrates how Frost\u2019s approach could be read in different ways. As a painter, Heron was also closely associated with St Ives and, as a critic, he promoted a formalist analysis of painting in which the illusion of shallow space was the benchmark of modernist quality. Until 1956, he also campaigned for the retention of a degree of figuration, in defiance of the group led by Pasmore, and his reading of Green, Black and White Movement reveals his desire to associate it with such priorities. Introducing Frost\u2019s work to a New York audience, he wrote:\n\nA painter of marked architectonic virtue, Frost ... [is] a pupil of Pasmore, his \u201cbrush-touch\u201d still resembles Pasmore\u2019s. But Frost\u2019s concern with space behind\nthe canvas, and with a landscape subject-matter from which he derives his forms, alienates him from the Pasmore of today. The limpid, swift clarity of the banana-forms in Movement in Green, Black and White, 1951, evokes the bobbing of moored rowing-boats in St Ives Harbour.[18]\n\nAn abstract manner based on landscape sources was synonymous with the art of St Ives in the early 1950s and was most successfully embodied in the work of Peter Lanyon whose attitude to landscape had an important influence on Frost. Lanyon\u2019s development of a post-Cubist landscape painting was based upon a subjective, temporal experience of a place which clearly affected Frost\u2019s description of Walk Along the Quay. Frost recalled how Lanyon influenced the way he saw the landscape:\n\nhe taught me to experience\nlandscape ... you lay down in the landscape, you looked up into a tree ... you walked over a landscape so that you understood its shape ... you walked over the hills and the high ground so that you knew what was above and below the forms you were going to draw, and all the while you\u2019re feeling those forms all through, you\u2019re travelling through the landscape.[19]\n\nIn a manner that referred back to the Cubists\u2019 multi-directional portrayal of figures and still-lifes, Lanyon produced paintings such as Porthleven, 1951 (Tate N06151), the shifting forms of which derived from his movement through the village. Frost\u2019s painting of St Ives harbour achieves a similar end while reworking a picturesque scene much favoured by the older, more academic artists of the town. In it space is ambiguous, as the viewer seems to be looking across at, and down upon, the boats. Both examples demonstrate a redefinition of landscape as a reflection of the artist\u2019s sense of being in a place as much as a depiction of a place.\n\nFrost had used a similar idea of progress across the picture surface in his first abstract painting, Madrigal, 1949 (Leamington Spa Art Gallery),[20]\nwhich derived from his reading of W.H. Auden\u2019s poem of the same name, that begins \u2018O lurcher-loving collier, black as night\u2019. The artist later explained how he began by sub-dividing the surface using the Golden Section and then used colour to express the emotion of the poem; the painting also clearly alludes to a landscape.[21]\nThe conception of the painting as narrative became a key characteristic of his approach as did the attempt at the creation of an empathetic emotional response in the viewer. Both were in contrast to the work of the other group of modernist artists with which Frost, through such paintings as Green, Black and White Movement, was associated: the Constructionists.\n\nThough the use of geometry to determine the form of a painting was common amongst many painters in Britain - including several in St Ives, such as John Wells and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham - such methods were particularly characteristic of the Constructionists\u2019 approach. This group, which included Heath, Pasmore, Robert Adams, Kenneth and Mary Martin and Anthony Hill, first showed together in the London Group exhibition in February 1951 and again at the Artists International Association\u2019s Abstract Paintings, Sculptures, Mobiles later that year. Walk Along the Quay can be seen in photographs of the latter exhibition, where its association with the work of the other artists obscured its picturesque origins.[22]\nFrost\u2019s principal debt was to Pasmore who, as his tutor, had encouraged him in his pursuit of a modernist manner in defiance of the dominant beliefs at Camberwell. Madrigal\nfollowed shortly after Pasmore\u2019s much publicised adoption of an abstract style and the development of the composition of such works as Green, Black and White Movement echoes Pasmore\u2019s production between 1948 and 1950. It is particularly noteworthy that Pasmore\u2019s use of the semi-circle in collages such as Abstract in White, Grey and Ochre, 1949 (Tate Gallery T00094), itself a possible reference to the Cubist depiction of guitars, is echoed in Frost\u2019s paintings.\n\nThe Golden Section was employed by the architect Le Corbusier and explained by Herbert Read in The Meaning of Art (republished in paperback in 1947),[23]\nbut Frost\u2019s knowledge of it and similar formulae originated from the treatment of compositions by William Coldstream (Professor of Painting at Camberwell) and his followers. That the use of such a methodology was passed from the advocates of a figurative manner to a group made up of the most extreme abstract artists is an indication of the importance of geometry in art at that time. Like those around him, Frost read the theories of geometric proportion in two key texts: Jay Hambidge\u2019s The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry and, later, Matila Ghyka\u2019s A Practical Handbook of Geometrical Composition and Design.[24]\nHis knowledge of abstract art was broadened at this time through reading, as he enjoyed access to the extensive library of Adrian Heath, then researching his book, Abstract Painting: Its Origin and Meaning.[25]\n\nFrost\u2019s interest in Russian Constructivism was probably informed by discussions with Nicholson, Hepworth and Lanyon, who had been very close to Naum Gabo during the war. Such was his commitment to the work of his London-based associates that, like many of them, he made several three-dimensional constructions, one of which was included in the first of a series of exhibitions held in Heath\u2019s Fitzroy Street studio in March 1952.[26]\nHowever, Frost\u2019s retention of an external source in the majority of his works positioned him on the periphery of this group. In July 1953 he was clearly anxious that such references would lead to his exclusion from one of the group\u2019s exhibitions, but was reassured by Kenneth Martin, who wrote, \u2018I doubt whether you\u2019d be excluded\u2019, while offering a rather unenthusiastic critique of Frost\u2019s work.[27]\nThe group was already fragmenting when Alloway wrote his introduction to Nine Abstract Artists (1954) in which his hesitation over Frost\u2019s work was clear:\n\nIn St Ives they combine non-figurative theory with the practice of abstraction because the landscape is so nice nobody can quite bring themselves to leave it out of their art ... Terry Frost, more than anyone else in this book, has been influenced by St Ives. He has described how he draws his paintings out of nature. His intuitive way of working is in line with Kandinsky who thought that emotion in the artist produced an art-work which then produced emotion in the observer .. There are objections to this notion ... In this kind of painting any eccentricity can be justified by reference to the inner element, emotion.[28]\n\nThis became a persistent criticism of the art of St Ives, which should be viewed within the broader debate over abstraction and realism that ran throughout the 1950s. Frost was unrepentant, however, justifying his retention of painting over construction in a notebook in 1954:\n\nConstruction for me is cutting out the mystery part of art, it\u2019s design for fashionable decoration (for the moment) ... The pure abstract I must admit I like, but I do not practise it for it does not seem to me to belong to us, but to be a departure from life ... and is now fast becoming academic and mannerist by the adoption of various geometric proportions all too readily at hand in the text book to the complete exclusion of any intuitive feeling.[29]\n\nThe unpredictable use of geometry in his work is thus explained by the fact that he makes intuition a priority.\n\nOne might see such a work as Green, Black and White Movement as appropriating one of the classic motifs of recent picturesque painting in Britain \u2013 boats in St Ives harbour \u2013 for a modern agenda. The retention of an external source, as advocated by Heron, signalled the desire to resist the perceived dehumanisation of the Constructionists. This is also marked by Frost\u2019s explanation of his work as a celebration and communication of particular emotional experiences. The combination of formal abstraction and sources from nature would persist throughout his work.\n\nChris Stephens\nDecember 2000\n\n[1]\nDavid Lewis, Terry Frost, Aldershot 1994, p.34\n[2]\nFor information on this group see Alastair Grieve, \u2018Towards an Art of Environment: Exhibitions and Publications by a Group of Avant-Garde Artists in London 1951-5\u2019, Burlington Magazine, vol.132, no.1052, November 1990, pp.773-81\n[3]\nInterview with the author, 4 May 1998\n[4]\nIbid.\n[5]\nIbid.; conversation with Ronald Alley, 19 June 1972, noted in Tate Gallery cataloguing files\n[6]\nTate Gallery conservation files\n[7]\nBlack and White Movement on Blue and Green II, 1951-2, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, reproduced in Terry Frost: Six Decades, exhibition catalogue, Royal Academy, London 2000, [p.40]\n[8]\nLetter to Ronald Alley, undated [February 1972], Tate Gallery catalogue files\n[9]\nTate Gallery conservation files\n[10]\nInterview with David Lewis, April 1979, quoted in Lewis 1994, p.52\n[11]\nLetter to Ronald Alley, undated [February 1972]\n[12]\nAccount published in Lawrence Alloway, Nine Abstract Artists, London 1954, pp.23-4; Blue Movement 1953, reproduced in David Lewis, Terry Frost, Aldershot 1994, p.61\n[13]\nAlloway 1954, p.12\n[14]\nMullion Cove, c.1949, Belgrave Gallery, London, reproduced Chris Stephens, Terry Frost, London 2000, p.22 (colour)\n[15]\nReproduced in Lewis 1994, p.47\n[16]\nNotes on the St Ives years, quoted in Lewis 1994, p.49\n[17]\nPatrick Heron, \u2018Space in Colour: Nine British Painters\u2019, Arts Digest, 15 March 1955, p.8-11\n[18]\nIbid.\n[19]\nFrom three interviews with David Lewis 1991-3, quoted in Lewis 1994, p.39\n[20]\nReproduced in David Lewis, Terry Frost, Aldershot 1994, p.46 (colour)\n[21]\nLewis 1994, p.42-4\n[22]\nReproduced in Alastair Grieve, \u2018Towards an Art of Environment: Exhibitions and Publications by a Group of Avant-Garde Artists in London 1951-5\u2019, Burlington Magazine, vol.132, no.1052, Nov. 1990, p.775 \n[23]\nHerbert Read, The Meaning of Art, London 1931, republished 1936, 1942, 1951 and as a Penguin paperback in 1947\n[24]\nJay Hambidge, The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry, New York 1926, 2nd\ned. 1948; Matila Ghyka, A Practical Handbook of Geometrical Composition and Design, London 1952\n[25]\nAdrian Heath, Abstract Painting: Its Origin and Meaning, London 1953\n[26]\nConstruction, 1951-2, whereabouts unknown, reproduced in Lewis 1994, p.17; installation shot of exhibition, Grieve 1990, p.777\n[27]\nLetter to Terry Frost, 21 July 1953, Tate Gallery Archive 7919.3.4\n[28]\nAlloway 1954, pp.12-13\n[29]\nUndated notes [c.1954] quoted in Chris Stephens, Terry Frost, London 2000, p.33.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1951", "dimensions": "Support: 1092 x 851 mm", "reference": "T01501", "title": "Green, Black and White Movement", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/frost-green-black-and-white-movement-t01501", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01501_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Terry Frost", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1915\u20132003", "artistbio": "\n Terry FROST b. 1915\n\nAbstract painter after beginning in the Euston Road Group Realist tradition.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Upto the late 1970s Frank Auerbach, one of the so-called School of London painters, took as his principal landscape subjects the park at Primrose Hill and the corner of Camden High Street and Mornington Crescent. In 1977 he added a third motif: the view of the entrance to his studio in North London. Auerbach began working at this studio in 1954. It is located in an alley in Camden and was built at the turn of the nineteenth century. The previous occupants include the painters Frances Hodgkins and Leon Kossoff. Since 1977 Auerbach has explored the subject extensively, making several paintings and innumerable sketches of the motif.\n\nOn the left of the picture a flight of steps leads to a semi-detached Victorian villa. The circular elements at the bottom right of the painting suggest a bicycle leaning against the gate which gives access to the alley. A flash of red paint leads the eye along the path to the area outside the entrance to Auerbach's studio. The large mass at the top right of the image, formed by hatched brushstrokes in yellow, green and crimson, describes a decaying block of maisonettes. At the centre of the picture is the sign at the entrance to the alley that reads 'To the Studios'.\n\nAs with his earlier paintings, Auerbach has used the same laborious practice of scraping away and reapplying paint until the final image has emerged. It is only through this process of constant revision that Auerbach is able to 'catch hold of the world of fact and experience at some point at which it hasn't been caught before, so that one remakes it in a sense which speaks to oneself directly\u2026' (quoted in John Christopher Battye, 'Frank Auerbach talks to John Christopher Battye', Art &amp; Artists, London 1971, p.55).\n\nThe considerable complexities of colour, composition and scale apparent in To the Studios distinguish the work from previous paintings of this scene. Compared to the predominantly dark hues of To the Studios 1979-80 (Tate T03247), principally blues set against strokes of purple, ochre and an acid yellow sky, the palette is particularly bold, ranging from the literal use of blue in the sky, to arresting juxtapositions of orange and green. A wide vocabulary of marks is also apparent. Space and form emerge from a dense lattice of lines, swirls, scribbles and patches of colour. The tension between Auerbach's treatment of the surface as a material object and the image's illusion of three-dimensional depth invigorates the entire composition.\n\nDuring the 1980s Auerbach increasingly employed more high key colours, his brushwork became looser, and his description of space opened out and became more literal. To the Studios embraces and extends these developments.\n\nFurther reading:Robert Hughes, Frank Auerbach, London 1990, p.214\n\nToby TrevesJune 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1990\u20131", "dimensions": "Support: 1695 x 1494 mm", "reference": "T06635", "title": "To the Studios", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/auerbach-to-the-studios-t06635", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06635_8.jpg", "artist": "Frank Auerbach", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1931", "artistbio": "\n Auerbach was born in Berlin of Jewish parents; his father was a lawyer and his mother a former art student.\nIn 1939 he was sent to England to escape Nazism. His parents, who remained behind, died in concentration camps. He spent his childhood at a progressive boarding school, Bunce Court, at Lenham near Faversham, Kent, a school for Jewish refugee children.\nDuring the war years the school was evacuated to Shropshire. He attended St Martin's School of Art, London, from 1948 to 1952, and studied with David Bomberg in night classes at Borough Polytechnic. It was during this period that he developed a\nfriendship with fellow student Leon Kossoff. Auerbach studied at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1955. He has used three principal models throughout his career: his wife Julia, who first posed for him in 1959; Juliet Yardley Mills ('J.Y.M.'), a\nprofessional model whom he met in 1957; and his close friend Estella (Stella) West ('E.O.W.'), the model for most of his nudes and female heads prior to 1973. Rarely leaving Britain, he lives and works in London and has had the same studio since the\n1950s. The dealer Helen Lessore at the Beaux-Arts Gallery, London, gave Auerbach his first solo show in 1956. He was criticised for his thick application of paint, but found support from the critic David Sylvester, who wrote of 'the most exciting\nand impressive first one-man show by an English painter since Francis Bacon in 1949'. Sylvester countered remarks by various critics that the artist's work was closer to sculpture than to painting: 'in spite of the heaped-up paint, these are\npainterly images, not sculptural ones, have to be read as paintings, not as polychrome reliefs, and make their point just because their physical structure is virtually that of sculpture but their psychological impact is that of painting' (Sylvester,\n'Young English Painting', The Listener, 12 January 1956). Kossoff later echoed these sentiments: 'in spite of the excessive piling on of paint, the effect of these works on the mind is of images recovered and reconceived in the barest and\nmost particular light, the same light that seems to glow through the late, great, thin Turners ... an unpremeditated manifestation arising from the constant application of true draughtsmanship' (in Frank Auerbach, exhibition catalogue, Arts\nCouncil, Hayward Gallery, London 1978, p.9).Auerbach exhibited regularly at the Beaux-Arts Gallery until 1963. From 1965 he exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery. He was given an Arts Council retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, London in 1978, and\nhad solo exhibitions at the British Pavilion in the 1986 Venice Biennale, and at the Rijksmuseum Vincent Van Gogh, Amsterdam, 1989. Group shows in which he has participated include Tooth and Sons, London, in 1958, Pittsburgh International\nExhibition at the Carnegie Institute in 1958 and 1961, '54/64 Painting and Sculpture of a Decade at the Tate Gallery, 1964, British Painting in the Sixties organised by the Contemporary Arts Society in 1964, and The Human\nClay, selected by R.B.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Instant Loveland is one of the largest canvases Olitski has ever painted. From\n1966, he began placing a greater emphasis on colour and explored the framing-edge. Along the top and sides of this work, coloured lines define the edge of what otherwise appears a film of delicate, tonally related colours (pinks, purples and greens).\nThe surface of the canvas is emphasised by the spiky texture created in places by the varying densities of pigment. In his statement for the 1966 Venice Biennale, 'Painting In Colour', Olitski wrote: 'When the conception of internal form is governed\nby edge, color ... appears to remain on or above the surface. I think, on the contrary, of colour as being seen in and throughout, not solely on, the surface'. The critic Rosalind Krauss, in her catalogue essay for the exhibition at the Institute of\nContemporary Art, Philadelphia 1968, a show which included Instant Loveland, wrote [p.4]: \tBecause the seeing of the surface is tied to the perception of a kind of color \twhich so opens and expands that surface toward the viewer\nthat it might be \tcharacterized as foreshortened, the very seeing of the painting in all its \tliteralness poses a question about where the surface is. To see Olitski's color \tmeans to see the surface itself as elusive and unaligned. It was\nthese qualities of surface and edge, and colour and line, which Krauss used to place Olitski's art in relation to the work of his contemporaries and in the history of modernism.Further reading:Jules Olitski, 'Painting In\nColour', Artforum, vol.5, no.5, Jan. 1967, p.20Rosalind E.

He took American nationality when\nserving in the United States army during the Second World War. He studied at the National Academy of Design, New York 1940-2, then, aided by the GI Bill, continued his studies in Paris, at the Ossip Zadkine School in 1949 and at the Acad\u00e9mie de la\nGrande Chaumi\u00e9re 1949-50. He had a solo show at the Galerie Huit in 1950, and as a result was invited to exhibit with the Cobra group. However, he returned to America where he continued to develop a painting style that had links with both Parisian\ninformel painting and American Abstract Expressionism. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from New York University in 1952, and a Master of Arts in 1954.In the late 1950s Olitski became friends with the influential American art critic\nClement Greenberg and in 1958 exhibited in a group show at French &amp; Co (a gallery for which Greenberg was a consultant). The show included such artists as Morris Louis, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland and David Smith. In 1960 Olitski began to pour and\nstain dye onto large canvases. He experimented with different methods of applying paint, using brushes, sponges, mops and rollers. From 1965 he began to spray paint onto his canvases in order to create dematerialised fields of colour. During these\nyears, when he was at the height of his fame and influence, he participated in several important group exhibitions including the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh (1961), Formalists at the Washington Gallery of Modern Art (1963), Three New\nAmerican Painters at Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery, Regina, Canada (1963), and the 1966 Venice Biennale.

Around this time he was introduced to the poet Coventry Patmore, whose house was a meeting-place for writers and artists. Here in 1853 Brett met Holman Hunt, an artist he admired and was determined to emulate.\nBrett read Ruskin's works avidly. The fourth volume of Modern Painters inspired him to set off for Switzerland where he met J. W. Inchbold, who was also there to paint mountain scenery. Inchbold's methods caused Brett to refine his own technique. The result was the Glacier of Rosenlaui. Greatly encouraged, Brett at once started work on his masterpiece, The Stonebreaker.\nCriticism of his work, together with a cooling in Ruskin's enthusiasm, may have been responsible for his decision to abandon landscape subjects for marine painting. \nBrett's most successful pictures were panoramic views of the sea. His beach scenes with meticulously rendered boulders and rock formations tend to be laboured and repetitive.\nApart from an obituary in The Times, his death passed almost unnoticed, although William Michael Rossetti pointed out that \u2018there is no one to succeed to the precise place which he occupied with distinction'.\nBibliographyA.

Increasingly, however, the majority of his exhibition contributions were small-scale, classical genre pictures. \nThe latter part of Poynter's career was marked by increasing involvement in public office.

When France fell in June 1940 the artist was evacuated to London and this was one of a number of canvases left in Aix during the war years in the care of Madame Monay, wife of the artist Pierre Monay. In 1946\u20137, Smith returned to Aix to recover these works and subsequently took them to Paris, where, in June 1947, he was joined by Richard Smart, who had agreed to help him transport the works back to England. Richard Smart, at that time a director of Tooth's Gallery, has confirmed that T02101 was among the paintings with which they returned to London on 5 June 1947. Later that year, Tooth's mounted an exhibition of these works, Paintings by Matthew Smith of the Years 1938\u20131940 (op. cit.); 18 of the 23 canvases shown were still lifes and T02101 was exhibited as one of a series of six numbered paintings with the same title. Richard Smart does not believe that the numbering of this series reflected its chronology but that the numbers appended by the artist are more likely to relate to the order in which the works were packed in France, or unpacked prior to the London exhibition.\n\nThe clay figure of the series provides the central motif for a number of Matthew Smith's still lifes of the period - other examples are: \u2018Clay Figure with Peaches\u2019 (1938\u201340), also exhibited in the 1947 exhibition and afterwards acquired by the late Lady Hayward of Adelaide, South Australia, and an un-numbered \u2018Still Life with Clay Figure\u2019 of c.1938. Other references are less overt. It is interesting to note the appearance of part of the figure's head, in an earlier still life, \u2018Peaches\u2019 (1937) (Tate Gallery, N05266). Richard Smart has suggested that the recurrent use of a sculptural image in his still lifes may have reflected the artist's long-standing friendship with Jacob Epstein.\n\nOf the remaining paintings in the clay figure series shown in 1947, the current ownership of three works has been established and a further work is known in reproduction. \u2018Still Life with Clay Figure, IV\u2019 (c.1939) - illustrated in the catalogue of the 1947 exhibition (10), opposite a portrait of Madame Monay - was acquired by Southampton Art Gallery in October 1947. \u2018Still Life...III\u2019 and \u2018Still Life...V \u2019 (d. 1938) remained in the possession of the artist and, on his death in 1959, became the property of Mrs Mary Keene, to whom he left the contents of his studio. Mary Keene has confirmed (letter 26.4.78) that these two paintings, together with a copy of \u2018Still Life...V \u2019 now form part of the Barbican Collection of works by Matthew Smith and writes...\u2018The background to V is a red screen (painted by M.S. with a cartoon of Leda and the Swan, also in the Barbican Coll:) showing as the red background of your picture\u2019. \u2018Still Life...V \u2019 together with \u2018Still Life...VI\u2019 were reproduced in an article by Mary Sorrell, (Matthew Smith, Apollo XLVIII, July 1948 p.31, figs.II and III). In the article Mary Sorrell described the clay figure in the still life series of the 1947 exhibition as having substituted Smith's \u2018usual reclining nude\u2019 and contrasted the static contemplative composition of \u2018Still Life... VI\u2019 with the looser and more rhythmic handling of the fifth version.\n\nMary Keene has a pencil drawing by Matthew Smith, (16 7/8 \u00d7 13in), which is a study for this series. Here the clay figure is viewed directly from behind, lying on a small table, head inclining slightly to the right and dominated by larger figures of Leda and the Swan. The left foreground shows a table with brushes, bottle and possibly a palette.\n\nThe clay figure itself was modelled by the artist in plasticine, and measures approximately 11 1/2 \u00d7 12 5/8in. It is now in the collection of an artist in Aix, having been left with him by Matthew Smith at the outbreak of the last war. Mary Keene writes... 'As to the clay figure itself: I have a small plaster replica 4 inches high of a figurine (standing) hands held to breasts that M.S. set great store by. I believe the original is in the Louvre where M.S. bought the replica. She also refers to \u2018a painting by M.S. a bust of a girl - Christiane de Mauberge [now in a private collection] - on which the upper part of the clay figure in the painting (T02101) is doubtless founded\u2019. In the light of this information, it is interesting to note that the torso and head in T02101 are painted in a lifelike manner which contrasts with the more simplified and static rendering of the rest of the figure. Mary Keene's daughter, who saw the clay figure in Aix, has confirmed that it has its right arm raised, which would seem to demonstrate that Smith's references for the painting were not solely confined to a straight-forward rendition of the figure he had modelled.\n\nSmith's awareness of the need for a sound structural framework, to counter-balance the emotive force of his colour, led to concentrated study of works by the artists of earlier periods. In this connection, John Russell has written (Apollo op. cit.) that one of Matthew Smith's favourite paintings was Courbet's \u2018The Corn Sifters\u2019 (1855), a work which he had carefully studied in the Museum at Nantes, and that the artist had once confided to Francis Halliday that the composition of T02101 had been based on this painting.\n\nWhile T02101 has been recorded as dating from 1936, 1938\u201340 and 1940 at different times, Richard Smart thinks it safe to assume that it was painted in 1939, the date given in the catalogue he compiled for the Royal Academy exhibition in 1960. He has pointed out that the late Francis Halliday was called in to advise on the dating of many of the paintings in this exhibition and, as the owner of T02101 and a close friend of the artist, would have been party to the most accurate information in this respect. This would confirm the theory that the still life series of the 1947 exhibition was numbered \u2018casually\u2019 in that \u2018Still Life with Clay Figure ...V \u2019 is dated 1938.\n\nAs both Mary Keene and Richard Smart have mentioned, the fact that Francis Halliday bought T02101, suggests that Matthew Smith regarded it as the most successful of the series.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1976-8: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1979\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1939", "dimensions": "Support: 730 x 1162 mm", "reference": "T02101", "title": "Still Life with Clay Figure, I", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/smith-still-life-with-clay-figure-i-t02101", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T02/T02101_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Matthew Smith", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1879\u20131959", "artistbio": "\n English painter. He studied art at Manchester College of Technology (1901\u20135) and the Slade School of Fine Art in London (1905\u20138) without showing particular promise. He settled in Paris, beginning to build more ambitious compositions using related and contrasting colours. In canvases painted between 1914 and 1920, when he joined the London Group, he acknowledged the flatness of the picture surface with areas of strong unmodulated colour and emphatic design. In 1920 Smith applied dark saturated colour and an increasing fluidity of construction to a series of Cornish landscapes. Strongly Expressionist in character, these are the culmination of his early style.\nAn increasing self-confidence in the 1920s led to the evolution of Smith's mature style. In marked contrast to his former approach, he now expressed a passionately spontaneous and celebratory response to his subject through an alla prima technique that enabled him to work very fast.\nSmith continued subsequently to work from traditional subjects, but with marked variations in his palette and use of paint. He spent the late 1920s and 1930s in France and produced many freely painted nudes, still-lifes, portraits and landscapes. After returning to London in 1940, he moved towards darker colorations and a more emphatic solidity of form. During the 1950s he produced his largest and most decorative canvases. The greater fluidity of Smith's later work brought him considerable success in regular exhibitions in London, and he was twice represented at the Venice Biennale (1938 and 1950). Smith was knighted in 1954.\nBibliographyP. Hendy: Matthew Smith (London, 1944)J.

Travelling by truck, train, aeroplane and boat, he journeyed inland across New South Wales to Adelaide. He then went north across the central desert to Darwin, returning via the Western coast to Sydney. The view of inland Australia seen from the air made the greatest impression on Nolan. He was profoundly affected by the vast scale, desolation and silence of the desert - the second largest in the world. Like his many other paintings of this subject, this work is what Nolan called a 'composite impression'. It combines documentary observation with visionary imagination, faithfully evoking a landscape whose immensity seems strangely unreal.\n \n \n \n August 2004\n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on hardboard", "date": "1950", "dimensions": "Support: 1219 x 1524 mm", "reference": "N05993", "title": "Inland Australia", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/nolan-inland-australia-n05993", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05993_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Sidney Nolan", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1917\u20131992", "artistbio": "\n Australian painter, draughtsman, printmaker and stage designer. Australia's most honoured and internationally acclaimed modern painter, he worked prolifically in a variety of media on themes that often related closely to the story of his own life. Alternating bright moods with blackest drama, reviving formal elements and iconography from previous works and maintaining a spontaneous style by devising new painting techniques.\nNolan was enrolled twice at the National Gallery of Victoria's School of Art (1934 and 1936) while employed as a commercial artist, but he preferred to educate himself in the public library. He wrote poetry and read omnivorously. From 1938 he was encouraged and supported by Sunday and John Reed, patrons and publicists whose house, \u2018Heide', became a focus for a close-knit avant-garde group. He was a founder-member of the Contemporary Art Society in that year and subsequently helped produce the radical Reed and Harris journal Angry Penguins.\n Nolan was conscripted into the army in 1942. By then he was working almost exclusively with ripolin, a fluid fast-drying, commercial enamel. He began to paint his immediate surroundings. In 1945 Nolan began his first paintings on the theme of Ned Kelly. \nFrom 1953, Nolan began travelling extensively from his new base in London. He returned repeatedly to the Kelly theme, each time in a different technique and mood. He produced a series of Chinese landscapes, mine workers of north-west Australia, Rimbaud's Africa and drawings for the poems of Dante, Shakespeare, Robert Lowell and the fictitious \u2018Ern Malley'. In 1987 he was made ARA.\nBibliographySidney Nolan: Catalogue of an Exhibition of Paintings from 1947 to 1957 (exh. cat. by K. Clark and C. MacInnes, London, Whitechapel A.G., 1957)C. MacInnes, K.

Motivated by the theories of Jung and Nietzsche, he began in paintings such as Hermaphrodite (1963; Liverpool, Walker A.G.) to depict fused male/female couples as metaphors of the creative act. While living in New York (1964\u20135) he discovered a rich fund of imagery in sexually motivated popular illustration of the 1940s and 1950s. Henceforth, in paintings such as Perfect Match (1966\u20137; Cologne, Mus. Ludwig), he made explicit the previously subdued eroticism, adopting a precise linear style as a means of emphasizing tactility. The full extent of his Pop sensibility emerged in sexually provocative fibreglass sculptures such as Chair (1969; London, Tate), life-size images of women as furniture with fetishist and sado-masochist overtones. In the mid 1970s he returned to a more painterly conception in canvases such as Santa Monica Shores (1977; London, Tate) and to a playful stylisation in figure sculptures, notably The Tango (1984; owned jointly by Liverpool, Walker A.G., and Merseyside Development Corp.), a larger than life-size dancing couple made from polychrome steel plate.

Educated locally, he attended the Slade School 1926-9, an institution with which he would be associated for most of his career and where he formed important friendships with such artists as Claude Rogers and Rodrigo Moynihan. In\n1933 he held a joint exhibition with H.E. du Plessis, sponsored by the London Artists' Association, at the Cooling Galleries; he first showed with the London Group in 1929, became a member in 1933 and showed sporadically until the late 1960s. In 1931,\nhe married Nancy Sharp, a fellow Slade painter; they had two daughters before their separation in 1939.In 1934 Coldstream's concern about the role of the artist in society and financial problems prompted him to join the GPO Film Unit under John\nGrierson, where his collaborators included W.H. Auden and Benjamin Britten. He continued to paint, however, and an annual stipend from Kenneth Clark (in response to the Plan for Artists that Coldstream wrote with Graham Bell) enabled him to\nreturn to full-time painting in 1937. Later that year, he, with Rogers and Victor Pasmore, co-founded a School of Drawing and Painting, known as the Euston Road School, with which their circle would become synonymous. Though he became principally a\nportrait painter, Coldstream's continued political commitment was witnessed by his 1938 painting trip with Bell to Bolton, Lancashire as part of Mass Observation's social survey of Britain.In 1940 he enlisted in the army and trained as a\ngunner until commissioned as an official war artist in 1943. He travelled to Egypt that year and to Italy in 1944. He returned home in July 1945 and joined several friends as a tutor at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in November. He became Head of\nPainting in 1948 but was appointed Slade Professor of Fine Art, University College, London the following year. Through his position at the Slade, Coldstream became a key art world official. He was a trustee of both the National Gallery (1948-63) and the\nTate Gallery (1949-63), a director of the Royal Opera House (1957-62) and chairman of the British Film Institute (1964-71). Having chaired the Art Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain (1953-62), he became Vice Chairman of the Council (1962-70). As\nChairman of the National Advisory Council on Art Education (1958-71) he was said to have reshaped British art education through what became known as the First and Second Coldstream Reports (1960 and 1970).These responsibilities, which were\nrewarded by a CBE in 1952 and a knighthood in 1956, and his famously slow working methods restricted Coldstream's production to three or four paintings a year. As a result, he rarely showed his work: a touring retrospective in 1962 was his first\none-person exhibition, though others followed in 1976 and 1984 at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery. Coldstream had married his former model, Monica Hoyer, in 1961 and they had three children. He retired from the Slade in 1975 and, following some years of\nill-health, died on 18 February 1987.Chris StephensAugust 1998Bibliography:Lawrence Gowing and David Sylvester, The Paintings of William Coldstream\n1908-87, exh. cat., Tate Gallery, London 1990Peter T.J.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n On 16 July 1889 Stanhope Alexander Forbes wrote to Sir Henry Tate (1819-1899) 'I myself will be rather occupied down here - no less a matter than my own wedding. It was inevitable after painting this picture' (quoted in Cook and Hardie, p.84). Forbes was writing from Newlyn where he had been staying since 1884. The small Cornish fishing village attracted a number of artists in the late nineteenth century including Thomas Cooper Gotch (1854-1931), Frank Bramley (1857-1915) and Walter Langley (1852-1922). Opposed to the insularity of British painting, these artists were encouraged to paint en plein air, taking much of their inspiration from the work of French naturalist painters such as Jules Bastien-Lepage (1848-1884) and Jules Breton (1827-1906), and often choosing 'working life' subjects.\n\nForbes recalled that the idea for the painting came to him when 'Standing in one of these inn parlours I had first thought of a painting of an anglers' meeting - you will notice one or two cases of fish on the wall - but it occurred to me that a wedding party could be much more picturesequely grouped, even though one had to paint them in the smarter, more conventional Sunday clothes' (quoted in Fox, p.28). Forbes depicts generations of the same family seated around a table at the wedding breakfast. A sailor raises a toast to the bride who stares pensively into her bouquet, her eyes not meeting the gazes of her admiring onlookers. \n\nThe Health of the Bride reflects many of the aims of the Newlyn artists at the time. Forbes has chosen to use non-professional models and a recognisable site, the local inn in Newlyn. In addition, he includes evidence of the local fishing industry, for example the stuffed fish, print of a painting of a ship and the masts of ships seen through the window. This painting can be included amongst a number of works by Forbes, including Off the Fishing Grounds (1886) and Old Newlyn (1884), which reveal an unchanging view of life in Newlyn at a time when rural activities and traditional ways of life were gradually disappearing. Forbes had a monopoly on such subjects in the eyes of the Victorian public, his paintings being characterised by their subdued palette and square brushwork.\n\nThe Health of the Bride received an enthusiastic response at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1899. The critic of the Art Journal remarked in 1893 that the 'solemn awkwardness of the young couple themselves, the knowledgeable indifference of the old, and the innocent unconcern of the very young - all these are managed with frankness and skill' (quoted in Cook, p.168). The painting was bought for the large sum of \u00a3600 by Sir Henry Tate and was to become part of the collection which he gave to the nation at the foundation of the Tate Gallery. The profits from the sale of the painting enabled Forbes to propose to the artist Elizabeth Armstrong (1859-1912) who had moved to Newlyn in 1885. Their marriage took place in St Peter's Church in Newlyn a few months after The Health of the Bride was completed \n\nFurther reading:E. T.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This painting is typical of Masson\u2019s style of the early 1920s. The placement of the musical instruments (a mandolin and the curving body of what appears to be a guitar) on a tabletop, and the rhyming of straight and curved lines, allude unmistakably to the pre-war cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Georges Braque (1882-1963).\n\nAlthough the neck of the mandolin appears as if seen from more than one perspective, there is no real attempt to employ the facets, planes or abstruse signs of cubist form language. Instead the painting seems largely realist in conception, with overt references to traditional still-life painting in the presence of the flowers, fruit and dead bird. In this sense, the painting could be seen as reflecting to some extent the themes \u2013 if not the values \u2013 of the post-war \u2018return to order\u2019 movement in France, which advocated qualities of clarity and harmony, and a modern reading of traditional art. But the unexplained elements, the strange spatial qualities and bleached coloration of his paintings of this period indicate a new and individual approach.\n\nRecalling the works of this period, the poet Georges Limbour \u2013 a friend of the artist from the earliest days \u2013 stressed the unnatural atmosphere of Masson\u2019s paintings. He described the painter as a \u2018magician\u2019 who concealed secrets and mystery behind everyday appearances. \u2018Wand in hand, and putting objects back to rest in their forms, Andr\u00e9 Masson seemed to approach painting along the path of calmness. But this calmness was all appearance. Behind it lurked disquiet and a certain metaphysical passion.\u2019 The bleached tones lent his imagery an ethereal quality. Masson, Limbour wrote, \u2018used a great deal of white, broken by a variety of reflections, the emotional substance of his dreaming. His early still-lifes were touched with those bewitching whites, and every object had a disturbing and somewhat nocturnal appearance: they seemed to be wearing a sort of white mask\u2019. (Limbour 1947, p.v.)\n\nBehind this white mask were indeed not only dreams \u2013 suggested perhaps by the spherical cloud forms in the background \u2013 but also darker emotions. If the flowers and dead bird could be seen as evoking life and death in somewhat conventional terms, the red pomegranate halves expressed an altogether more bloody and violent vision. The fruit\u2019s seeds can be said to symbolise the force of life and regeneration, but the red interior also evokes viscera. Later Masson was to acknowledge that the pomegranate \u2013 the French word for which also means grenade \u2013 evoked for him the memory of the blown-open skull of a soldier in the battlefields of Champagne. His experience of serving in the trenches for three years in the First World War, and of being left for dead in a battle, had scarred him profoundly both physically and mentally, and surfaced in the violent and carnal imagery of some of his later work.\n\nFurther reading\nGeorges Limbour, \u2018Scenes of Everyday Life\u2019, translated by Douglas Cooper, in Michel Leiris and Georges Limbour, Andr\u00e9 Masson and his Universe, Geneva and Paris 1947, p.iv-vii\nDawn Ades, Andr\u00e9 Masson, translated by Jacques Tranier, Paris 1994\nJennifer Mundy, \u2018Andr\u00e9 Masson\u2019, in Jennifer Mundy (ed.), Cubism and its Legacy: The Gift of Gustav and Elly Kahnweiler, exhibition catalogue, Tate Modern, London 2004, p.74, reproduced p.75 in colour\n\nJennifer Mundy\nDecember 2003\nRevised by Giorgia Bottinelli\nJune 2004\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1922", "dimensions": "Support: 500 x 604 x 20 mm", "reference": "T06819", "title": "Pedestal Table in the Studio", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/masson-pedestal-table-in-the-studio-t06819", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06819_8.jpg", "artist": "Andr\u00e9 Masson", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1896\u20131987", "artistbio": "\n Andr\u00e9 Masson born 1896 [- 1987]French painter, sculptor, illustrator, designer and\nwriter, born at Balagny (Oise).

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Rae\u2019s paintings push abstraction to the edge of figuration. She studied Fine Art at Goldsmith\u2019s College London (1984-7) and participated in Freeze, the seminal exhibition of young British artists (subsequently known as yBas) organised by Damien Hirst (born 1965) in London\u2019s Docklands in 1988. Her paintings of the late 1980s comprise rows of miniature pictures, each made up of a combination of colours, forms and brushstrokes, against a neutral ground. In these works, the graphic qualities of individual pictures result in the appearance of a pictograph, each one resembling an unknown letter or symbol. This sense of meaning is undermined by the evident materiality of the paint. In the early 1990s, she expanded and developed these structures to cover a single canvas. In such paintings as Untitled (grey and brown) 1991 (Tate T06481), the background is made up of a variety of geometric and organic forms in monotone colours, usually identified in the title. In colours ranging from neutral white, beige, browns and black to vivid pink, yellow and turquoise, these monotone sections provide the stage for a virtuoso performance of painterly mark-making. Dribbles, squiggles and smudges overlay wider bands of gestural streaks made using a brush loaded with more than one paint colour. The canvas may be turned several times after the application of paint, resulting in drips travelling in different directions. Finely delineated lines in a variety of styles trace under and across areas of paint smeared with a finger tip. On the same canvas, thick patches of impasto contrast with Pollock-like spatters and crude graffiti strokes depicting no recognisable form. Rae\u2019s paintings recall aspects of the work of such American Abstract Expressionists as Willem De Kooning (1904-97) and Cy Twombly (born 1928) and German painters Hans Hofmann (1880-1966) and Georg Baselitz (born 1938), combined with more contemporary cultural references. She has said: \u2018I have an unhierarchical approach in that any one kind of painting language is potentially as interesting as another. And in the work itself nothing takes precedence. I guess that\u2019s what you call democratic.\u2019 (Quoted in Fiona Rae 1996, p.24.)\n\nWith large areas of white ground left untouched, Untitled (yellow) is an unusually empty painting for its period. It marks a transition between the earlier rows of painterly symbols on a white ground and the intensely busy and colourful compositions Rae produced in the mid 1990s. In the top left corner an area of monotone orange develops into a cacophony of energetic and colourful forms. These include a thick, dark streak extending vertically three-quarters down the painting, accompanied by an area of purple paint, half covered by white smeary marks, which dribbles down beside it, a tree or polyp-like pink form sprouting orange streaks in the centre-right of the canvas and a dramatic red line, the result of a single brush-stroke, which undulates down the right side of the painting. On the left side, beside the dark streak, a rounded black form resembling an element from a Rorschach diagram is edged with pink and yellow specks. Small pink blobs exude hair-like black lines. Another fine black line wriggles across the canvas from the upper left to the pink polyp. The painting offers a series of visual symbols, which hint at but deny legibility, at the same time as emphasising the luxuriant texture and rich colour of the medium. The composition appears chaotic but is the result of studied decision on the part of the artist. Rae\u2019s paintings explore the balance between a controlling principle or concept and the unpredictability (and uncontrollable nature) of expression. She has explained: \n\n\nEverything is happening by accident. But what interests me is at what moment does the accident actually happen? The accident might have taken place in my mind. How do you know what is the accident and what is the intention? You may point out that this part is really controlled but I might think of it as the biggest accident of all. It is not at all what I meant. It is not what I intended ... intention is what an accident is. I mean an accident is when your intention isn\u2019t carried out in a sense ... the brush stroke is always a representation of itself at the same time. I watch myself having an accident.\u2019\n\n(Quoted in Fiona Rae 1996, p.28.)\n\n\nFurther reading:\nFiona Rae, exhibition catalogue, Carr\u00e9 d\u2019Art, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de N\u00eemes 2002, p.50, reproduced (colour) [p.80]\nSarah Kent, Fiona Rae Gary Hume, exhibition catalogue, Saatchi Gallery, London 1997, [pp.3-9 and 16-47]\nSean Rainbird, Turner Prize 1991, exhibition brochure, Tate Gallery, London 1991, [pp.8-9], reproduced (colour) [p.8]\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nFebruary 2003\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1990", "dimensions": "Support: 2133 x 1981 mm", "reference": "T06482", "title": "Untitled (yellow)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rae-untitled-yellow-t06482", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06482_8.jpg", "artist": "Fiona Rae", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1963", "artistbio": "\n British painter. She completed a foundation course at Croydon College of Art (1983\u20134), and a BFA at Goldsmiths College, London (1984\u20137). Her reputation was quickly established; a year after her inclusion in the exhibition Freeze (curated by fellow artist Damien Hirst in 1988), she showed at the Waddington Galleries in London. She was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1991. Rae makes highly coloured, vivid abstract paintings that draw on and develop a variety of formal, painterly motifs. Common to all her work is the self-conscious juxtaposition of flat areas of colour with dragged, daubed or scumbled paint marks. Although her compositions can appear accidental, almost arbitrary, close inspection reveals a highly controlled handling of paint and style and a tight underlying structure. As her work developed throughout the 1990s it became still more structured, and focused in a more condensed manner on certain motifs. Untitled (Parliament) (oil and acrylic on canvas, 2.74\u00d72.44 m, 1996; London, Saatchi Gal.) presents varied target motifs, perhaps referring to paintings made in the early 1960s by Kenneth Noland, floating in a furious field of black and white. The stillness and formal calm of the circles plays off the chaos of their surround, an instance of the strongly antithetical juxtapositions that Rae often employs. Her approach to painting is based on a playful engagement with her predecessors, using both quotation and a repertoire of surface effects to suggest both the superficiality and self-absorption of the act of painting.\nBibliographyFiona Rae (exh. cat., New York, John Good Gal., 1994)Fiona Rae (exh. cat., essay R.

Arnason has described how the 'Open' series originated in a sort of accident early in 1967 when Motherwell happened to lean a small canvas from the 'Summertime in Italy' series against a large vertical canvas on which he was still working, which had its entire surface painted ochre. Finding that he liked the relationship of the small to the large rectangle, he outlined the small painting in charcoal on the ochre ground and thereby created an effect suggesting an opening or door at the bottom. He originally intended to add some free figuration either within the 'door' or around it, but decided in the end to leave it as it was apart from reversing the canvas, so that the small rectangle now appeared to be descending from the top. This picture became the first of the 'Open' series, though the title was not arrived at until a number of versions had been painted. The choice of this word was probably derived from the idea of a window in a large wall (though Motherwell did not want any implication that it was a window opening from interior to exterior space), but it also appealed to him because of its various associations, especially those of openness and simplicity. The title also incorporates a number indicating the order of the painting, and in most cases a description of the colours used. (Many of the paintings have the enclosed rectangle painted a contrasting colour).\n\nBolton Landing was the home of his great friend the sculptor David Smith, who died in a lorry accident in 1966, and Motherwell even thought at one time of calling this picture 'Elegy for David Smith'. He writes (2 October 1970) that David Smith was his closest complete friend, that is he had a wider range of interests in common than any other artist he had known, and a very similar, independently arrived at, aesthetic. He first met him in 1950 when he wrote a catalogue preface at his request for an exhibition of his, and they became very close friends from 1958 until his death. He made a picture for him after his death called 'The Forge', but was not satisfied with it. 'Open No.121 (Bolton Landing Elegy)' struck him as what he really meant, but the title was not given until afterwards.

She studied at Cheltenham Art School (1925-7) and the Slade School of Art (1927-31), where her Judith Showing the Head of Holofernes (present whereabouts unknown) won the Summer Composition Prize (1929) and was shown at the Royal Academy (1931). Large scale classical or biblical figure compositions prevailed in her work and she remained a member of the Society of Mural Painters into the 1940s. While still at the Slade she began to be interested in esoteric literature and occult sects. In 1931-3 Colquhoun submitted for the British School at Rome Scholarship, but also took a studio in Paris, where she was a neighbour of Paule V\u00e9zelay and became aware of Surrealism. She travelled to Greece (1933), Tenerife (1936) and Corsica (1937-8), and held two solo exhibitions in 1936 (Cheltenham Art Gallery and Fine Art Society, London), which included botanical watercolours on silk. \n\nFollowing the London International Exhibition of Surrealism (New Burlington Galleries, July, 1936), Colquhoun exaggerated the anthropomorphic qualities of her botanical works in line with Salvador Dal\u00ed's illusionisticpaintings. She contributed to the Surrealist London Bulletin and joined the movement in 1939, sharing an exhibition with Roland Penrose (Mayor Gallery, June 1939). Shortly after, she met the Surrealists' leader Andr\u00e9 Breton in Paris just as 'automatic' painting techniques were being modified by the 'psychological morphologies' of Matta and Gordon Onslow-Ford. Abbreviating this term to 'psychomorphologies', Colquhoun made her own contribution to the capturing of psychic space in painting. This automatism characterised her work for twenty-five years, and resulted in two theoretical texts, 'The Mantic Stain' (Enquiry, Oct. 1949) and 'Children of the Mantic Sun' (Athena, 1951). Despite these parallels, Colquhoun broke with Surrealism in 1940 rather than sacrifice her interest in the occult. The break deepened with her marriage to Toni del Renzio in 1942, whose polemics split the British Surrealist group; they were acrimoniously divorced in 1947. \n\nColquhoun moved to Cornwall in the late 1940s, where her interest in automatism and the esoteric became combined. She was an acknowledged authority on the occult, and her writing ranged from contributions to such periodicals as Prediction to Surrealist texts gathered as The Goose of Hermogenes (1961). She exhibited with the London Group and at the Leicester Galleries, and with the Women's International Art Club in the 1950s and 1960s. Renewed interest in British Surrealism led to a number of retrospectives in the 1970s.

He met other like-minded artists, and even such architects as J. J. P. Oud. In August 1916 Oud commissioned him to design a stained-glass window. This commission was followed by numerous others in stained glass. He produced series of drawings from a single subject where the heavy, emphatic outline was progressively \u2018essentialised' to a minimum of horizontal and vertical lines bounding coloured planes.

He entered the Slade School of Art, London, in 1875. In 1877 he won a Slade scholarship and in 1880 travelled to Italy, where he made his first nude life drawings, an important revelation to him of light, colour and the human form. From 1881 to 1883 he was in Paris and met Jules Bastien-Lepage. Admiring Bastien-Lepage's practice of focusing different areas of a painting by degrees of finish, Tuke adopted this in his own mature work.\nIn 1883 Tuke settled in Newlyn, Cornwall, and was a founder-member of the Newlyn school. During the 1880s he produced anecdotal plein-air paintings of the life of the Cornish fishing community.\nIn 1892 Tuke travelled to Italy, Corfu and Albania; thereafter his palette lightened dramatically, and his technique gained a new Impressionistic freedom. The nude adolescent male emerged as his principal motif. His admiration of James McNeill Whistler appears in the creation of mood at the expense of narrative and in his preference for evocative titles. \nIn 1886 Tuke was a founder-member of the New English Art Club and in 1900 he was elected an ARA. Impersonality and detachment combined with sincere commitment to subject and atmosphere characterise his mature style and challenged artistic expectations of the time, broadening the parameters of British plein-air painting.\nIn 1923 Tuke visited Jamaica and Central America, producing some fine watercolours. He became ill and was forced to return home. He never fully recovered his health, although his passion for travel remained undiminished.BibliographyM. T.

His preference was for emotionally charged figurative groupings in which the figures appeared embedded in the matrix of the picture. The often manic humour helped place Hodgkin in the climate of Pop art, although he was not directly associated with the movement. Hodgkin was always concerned to make the picture an object, and from 1970 he worked not on canvas but on assertive wooden supports, such as drawing boards or door frames.\nHodgkin's paintings are generally small in scale, consciously conceived within the tradition of European easel painting. He painted extremely slowly, sometimes taking up to four years or more on one work. During this process the clarity of the original imagery was often obscured, and the spectator was invited to decipher the finished image as a kind of riddle.\nIn the 1970s Hodgkin's work shifted from a collaged geometric flatness to a more complex fluid patterning. He applied a restricted range of simple shapes and marks to a variety of moods: lyrical and poetic, or openly erotic, as in Goodbye to the Bay of Naples (1980\u201382; priv. col., see 1984 exh. cat., p. 67), with a belly and penis in the foreground set into a frame representing repeated eruptions from Mount Vesuvius.\nHodgkin consistently stressed the self-sufficiency of the marks and formal structure of his work. The oblique and even mystificatory imagery, however, also entailed a defence of intimate values in expressing the most fugitive, human and vulnerable sensations.BibliographyJ.

Believing that the possibilities of two dimensions were far from exhausted and that a visual assault on the retina producing an illusion of vibration was itself a branch of kinetics, he chose to paint in black and white because of their maximum contrast. Moreover a composition in white and black could be transposed into black and white on a negative-positive basis to produce a further composition of equal interest. \n\nVasarely wrote (6 October 1965) that he regards the theme 'Supernovae', like all his kinetic compositions, as a project for a monumental work to be integrated with architecture, though it had not so far been carried out on a large scale. It has given rise to three further compositions, 'Metagalaxie' 1959-61, 'Novae' 1959-65 and 'Centauri' 1959-65, and he had in mind some day to make a variant with the blacks and whites reversed. 'Supernovae' was reproduced in this way, in the negative, as a photographic version of this idea, on the cover of Art International, May 1965. \n\nSupernovae are stars which suddenly increase greatly in luminosity, then undergo various changes which apparently include casting off a considerable proportion of their mass. \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, p.745, reproduced p.745 \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1959\u201361", "dimensions": "Support: 2419 x 1524 mm", "reference": "T00676", "title": "Supernovae", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/vasarely-supernovae-t00676", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00676_8.jpg", "artist": "Victor Vasarely", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1908\u20131997", "artistbio": "\n Victor Vasarely born 1908 [- 1997]School of Paris abstract painter, designer and maker\nof screenprints.

At fourteen, Wood began to draw during recuperation from septicaemia, and went on to study architecture briefly at Liverpool University (1919-20). In London in 1920, the French collector\nAlphonse Kahn invited him to Paris, where Wood studied drawing at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in 1921. He entered effortlessly into fashionable artistic circles, meeting Augustus John and the Chilean diplomat Antonio de Gandarillas, with whom he began to\nlive. As well as providing financial support, Gandarillas introduced Wood to Picasso, Georges Auric and Jean Cocteau, and to the use of opium. Although his painting was regarded as charmingly untutored, he learnt from these acquaintances, especially\nadopting the elegant line of Cocteau's drawings. By 1926 Wood was in a position to make designs for Romeo and Juliet for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. When these designs were abandoned at the last moment, he concentrated on England, becoming\na member of the London Group (1926)and the Seven and Five Society (1926-30). He exhibited with Ben and Winifred Nicholson at the Beaux Arts Gallery (April-May 1927), becoming close to them personally and artistically. In particular, Winifred was\nsupportive in the aftermath of his failed elopement with the painter and heiress Meraud Guinness (subsequently Meraud Guevara, q.v.). He painted with the Nicholsons in Cumberland and Cornwall in 1928. On a trip to St Ives, he and Ben Nicholson\nencountered the fisherman painter Alfred Wallis, whose work answered a shared interest in 'primitive' expression and helped Wood to establish a personal style. A solo exhibition at Tooth's Gallery (April 1929) was followed by an exhibition with\nNicholson at the Galerie Bernheim in Paris (May 1930), in which Wood showed paintings made in Brittany in 1929. The results of a second stay in Brittany (June-July 1930) were intended to open the Wertheim Gallery in London in October. Travelling with\nhis paintings, Wood met his mother in Salisbury on 21 August 1930. Possibly believing himself pursued (an effect of withdrawal fromopium), he threw himself under the London train. In deference to his mother, his death was often subsequently described as\naccidental. Posthumous exhibitions were held at the Wertheim Gallery (Feb. 1931) and the Lefevre Galleries (1932). In 1938 Wood's paintings were included in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In the same year a major exhibition was organised\nby the Redfern Gallery at the New Burlington Galleries, which attempted to re-unite Wood's complete works, and gave impetus to Neo-Romanticism.Eric Newton, Christopher Wood, Redfern Gallery, London 1938Richard Ingleby, Christopher\nWood: An English Painter, London 1995We would like to thank the following for their assistance with our research: M.

He claimed to have gone to sea at the age of nine and was involved in deep-sea fishing, sometimes sailing as far as Newfoundland. In 1890 he moved to St Ives where he set up as a marine scrap merchant. In 1912 he retired. His wife died in 1922, whereupon he took up painting.\nIn 1928 Christopher Wood and Ben Nicholson discovered Wallis in St Ives. Both artists were already working in a primitive idiom but were further encouraged by the discovery of Wallis. His principal subjects were ships at sea and shipwrecks, especially the ships that had disappeared during his lifetime. Other typical subjects were landscapes with trees and houses. His paintings rarely depict people. He used very few colours, and one associates with him some lovely dark browns, shiny blacks, fierce greys, strange whites and a particularly pungent Cornish green.\nWallis regarded his paintings as expressions of his experiences. He was unaware of linear perspective but arranged the objects depicted in terms of relative importance, determining their sizes accordingly.

While his pictorial naivety appealed in particular to Wood, his handling of materials attracted Nicholson. Wallis died in Madron Workhouse.

He trained at Sheffield College of Art (1951\u20136) and the Royal Academy Schools (1956\u201360). He began by 1954 to paint Sheffield landscapes and abstractions from still-life subjects. At the Situation exhibitions of 1960\u201361 he showed some of his earliest fully abstract paintings in which he used bands of colour to explore perceptual effects such as the relationship of image to background or to create the illusion of buckling the picture-plane. This geometric character soon gave way to sinuous lines enclosing discs of colour, and eventually to a freer and more fluid application of paint.\nHoyland's visit to New York in 1964 brought him into contact with Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski and the critic Clement Greenberg, who showed him the work of Hans Hofmann and Morris Louis. Elements from these American developments, especially from colour field painting and Post-painterly Abstraction, feature prominently in subsequent canvases by Hoyland such as 1.11.68 (1968; London, Tate) in the use of staining techniques and acrylic paint, the interaction of unmixed colours, and an emphasis on the material weight of paint. Hoyland came to reject the American tendency to reductivism, concentrating in later paintings on the approach exemplified by Hofmann and de Sta\u00ebl, with varied and tactile paint surfaces and a disposition of blocks of different colours to create sensations of advancing and receding space. From the late 1960s Hoyland applied these methods also to screenprints, lithographs and later to etchings and monotypes.\nBibliographyJohn Hoyland: Paintings, 1960\u201367 (exh. cat. by B.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Trouble in Paradise\nhovers between representation and abstraction, between the depiction of figures engaged in an indistinct sexual act and a bravura display of brushwork. Broad areas of flesh colour on the left of the picture suggest a woman\u2019s parted legs. In the top left corner of the painting is a face, its mouth gaping in pleasure or horror. A grey form in the centre of the composition resembles a man\u2019s naked back. Set against a black background which heightens the drama of the painting, ribbons and swirls of warm colour cover almost the entire surface of the painting.\n\nBrown\u2019s work is a visceral representation of sexuality in paint, with bodies depicted in bold painterly gestures and fleshy colours. Brown\u2019s evident mastery of her medium is evidenced in the fluency with which she moves from anatomical description to sheer exuberant gesturalism. Vibrant red, yellow and pink paint has been worked into the canvas in impasto layers. The painting is covered with a glossy varnish, giving the surface a reflective, tactile finish.\n\nTrouble in Paradise was painted in New York, where the British-born artist has lived and worked since the mid-1990s. It marks a shift in Brown\u2019s work from earlier, more explicit depictions of orgiastic abandon to looser, more allusive imagery. Passages in the painting refer to bits of the anatomy, most obviously in the left half of the image, where fragmented parts of a female body are visible beneath a carnivalesque riot of colour. It is possible to see the head and shoulder of a leering man dominating the top right corner and caricatured mask-like faces appearing out of the swirls in the top left and middle right of the image. Almost as soon as these figures appear they melt away. The writer A.M. Homes has likened the experience of looking at Brown\u2019s work to undertaking a psychodiagnostic test. She describes the paintings as \u2018your personal projection, your retinal Rorschach\u2019 (Homes, \u2018Motion Pictures\u2019, Cecily Brown, p.67). The implication is that what is visible in the paintings may be as much to do with the viewer\u2019s projected desires as the artist\u2019s intention. This is confirmed by the artist\u2019s own description of her work. Brown has claimed, \u2018the place I am interested in is where the mind goes when it\u2019s trying to make up for what isn\u2019t there\u2019 (quoted in Robert Evr\u00e9n, \u2018A Dispatch from the Tropic of Flesh\u2019, Cecily Brown, p.8).\n\nBrown\u2019s style is indebted to the gestural expressionism of Willem de Kooning (1904-97). Her bold use of colour, dramatic variation of brushwork and sexualised subject matter all recall the monumental series of paintings of women de Kooning began in the early 1950s (see The Visit,\u00a01966-7, Tate T01108). The dreamlike eroticism of Trouble in Paradise evokes drawings by Andr\u00e9 Masson (1896-1987), while Brown\u2019s hybrid biomorphic forms show the influence of Arshile Gorky (1904-48).\n\nFurther reading:\nRobert Evr\u00e9n and A.M.

She studied in London at the Slade School of Fine Art, graduating in 1993. As a painter Brown felt remote from the \u2018Young British Artist' phenomenon dominating London, so in 1994 she moved to New York. Her first work to gain recognition was the animated film Four Letter Heaven (1995), which had its premiere at Telluride Film Festival and then toured Europe and the USA. In it she introduced themes that were to become central to her work: pornography, the depiction of flesh and the sensuality of paint. Her first paintings were large-scale depictions of bodies in orgiastic, semi-abstract sprawls, for example Puce Moment (1997; see 1998 exh. cat.). Her paintings have been compared to those of Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Sue Williams, given her attention to bodies in space painted in an expressionistic manner. Their surfaces are often varnished, so that the viewer is held back from their intense images.\nMany of her paintings are titled after movie musicals, as in the case of Father of the Bride (1999; Buffalo, NY Albright-Knox A.G.), where the paint quality becomes the focus of the subject-matter, with pastel-coloured swirls threatening to engulf the figure of a man. Brown's work has a humour and a passion that take on the legacy of the male Abstract Expressionists and overturn their epic compositions, using her interest in paint to present mocking sexual imagery in a disturbing combination of sensuality and repulsion.\nBibliographyThe New Neurotic Realism (exh. cat., essay D.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Although Cox had previously made tours of Wales, it was only after settling at Harborne\nnear Birmingham in 1841 that he began to visit the area regularly. Bettws-y-Coed was his favourite destination, reached by train via Chester, Rhyl and Conway, where he usually took a jaunting car for the rest of the journey. These visits began in 1842.\nHe spent a day or two at Rhyl that August on his way to Bettws and first exhibited a watercolour of Rhyl sands at the Society of Painters in Water Colours the following year. Cox's most celebrated paintings of Rhyl are the oils he made in 1854, at\nthe age of seventy-one. He set out on 4 August that year with his son, his old friend William Stone Ellis and his housekeeper Mrs Fowler. 'They went to Rhyl, Abergele, and on to Pentrefoilas, and afterwards to Capel Curig, not very far from Bettws',\nhis first biographer records. 'They were away some weeks on this trip, and Cox, although feeble, was able to go on with his work as usual. Later in the autumn Cox felt rather restless, regretting that he had not been to stay at dear old Bettws, so he\nmade a second journey into Wales' (N.N. Solly, Memoir of the Life of David Cox, 1873, reprinted 1973, p.179). It is not known whether he stopped at Rhyl on this second visit. Three oils by Cox of Rhyl sands have survived, although it is\nknown from sales records that he made others. Closest in style to the Tate's painting is the picture in Manchester City Art Gallery, which shares the same light palette and sketch-like handling. In the Manchester version the buildings at the right of\nRhyl Sands are seen from a wider angle and given greater prominence, while the sky is more uniformly painted and less broken up by clouds. A much larger and more conventionally finished canvas, dated 1854-5, is in Birmingham City Art Gallery.\nUnlike the Manchester and Tate pictures, this shows Rhyl sands at or near high tide. The sea is a principal feature of the composition and the figures are concentrated on what remains of the beach at the right-hand side. The date of the Tate Gallery and\nManchester paintings is not known, but the pictures may well have been the starting point for the more elaborate Birmingham canvas of 1854-5 and can therefore reasonably be associated with Cox's visits to Rhyl in 1854. Neither appears to have been sold\nin Cox's lifetime. Several watercolours by Cox of Rhyl sands are known, including one, dated 1854, which corresponds approximately in composition to the Manchester and Tate paintings. It is difficult to say whether this or possibly other watercolours\nwere used in any way as preparations for the two oils or whether the latter were painted directly on the spot, which is the impression they give. Primarily a watercolorist, Cox only took up oil painting seriously around 1840, when he took lessons\nfrom William M-4ller. Rhyl Sands shows him working with total mastery in the medium. According to his friend and second biographer William Hall, Cox 'had misgivings that his method of working was not in accordance with the accepted practice -\nhe cherished the notion that there were secrets which \"the oil men\" would not tell him ... He suspected that something was wrong, or at least odd and unusual in the manipulation, or in the laying on of his colours' (J.T. Bunce, ed., A Biography of\nDavid Cox, 1881, pp.153-4). Cox's technique in the Tate and Manchester pictures, and indeed his whole approach, is certainly unique in British landscape painting of the 1850s.

In around 1798, aged fifteen, he was\napprenticed to a miniature painter named Fieldler. Following Fieldler's suicide, Cox was apprenticed around 1800 as assistant to a theatre scene-painter named De Maria. In 1804 he took work as a scene-painter with Astley's Theatre and moved to London.\nBy 1808 he had abandoned scene-painting, taking water-colour lessons with John Varley. In 1805 he made the first of his many trips to Wales, with Charles Barber; his earliest dated watercolours are from this year. Throughout his lifetime he made\nnumerous sketching tours to the home counties, North Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Devon.Cox exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1805. His pictures never sold for high prices, and his earned his living chiefly as a drawing-master.\nThrough his first pupil, Col. the Hon. H. Windsor (the future Earl of Plymouth), who engaged him in 1808, Cox acquired several other aristocratic pupils. He wrote several books, including Ackermann's New Drawing Book (1809); A Series of\nProgressive Lessons (1811); Treatise on Landscape Painting (1813); and Progressive Lessons on Landscape (1816). The ninth and last edition of his Series of Progressive Lessons was published in 1845.In 1810 he was\nelected President of the Associated Artists in Water Colour. In 1812, following the demise of the Associated Artists, he was elected an Associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colour (Old Water Colour Society). He was elected a Member of the\nSociety in 1813, and exhibited there every year except 1815 and 1817, until his death. In about 1814-15 he was appointed drawing-master at the Military Staff College, Farnham. With his appointment as drawing-master at Miss Croucher's girls' school he\ntook up residence in Hereford. He made his first trip to the Continent, to Belgium and Holland, in 1826, and moved to London the following year. He exhibited for the first time with the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1829, and with the Liverpool\nAcademy from 1831. In 1839 two of Cox's watercolours were bought from the Old Water Colour Society exhibition by the Marquis of Conynham for Queen Victoria. Around 1840 Cox took up oil painting, studying under W.J. M\u00fcller. He exhibited two oil\npaintings at the Royal Academy in 1844. From 1844 until 1856 he spent summers at Bettws-y-Coed, in North Wales. His health suffered following a stroke in 1853. In 1855 he was represented by watercolours at the Paris Universal Exhibition. By 1857,\nhowever, his eyesight had deteriorated. An exhibition of his work was arranged in 1858 by the Conversazione Society, Hampstead, and in 1859 a retrospective exhibition was held at the German Gallery, Bond Street, London. Cox died several months later. He\nwas buried in Harborne, near Birmingham, where he had retired in 1841.Further reading:Stephen Wildman (ed.), David Cox 1783-1859, exhibition catalogue, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, Birmingham 1983N.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Veil is a square, mainly black, painting. Its surface is of such a delicate nature that it is dramatically transformed by different light conditions and defies any attempt to photograph or reproduce it. The work consists of a black acrylic ground over which the artist has inscribed Arabic language, expressing Sufi thoughts. She used pencil with varying degrees of pressure to determine the strength and weakness of the graphite application.\n\nShirazeh Houshiary was born in Iran in 1955. She has lived and worked in England since 1973 when she moved to London. She studied at Chelsea Art College from 1976 \u2013 1979. Her work has consistently drawn on Islamic traditions, particularly on Sufi mysticism, for its form and content. Sufism, although rooted in Islamic spirituality, has been influenced by the beliefs of other faiths, among them Neo-Platonism and Buddhism. Houshiary established herself first as a sculptor, but has more recently worked exclusively on canvas. In her earlier two-dimensional works the marks with which she created geometric patterns on the canvas were composed of minute sacred words, repeated like a mantra. In her more recent work, such as Veil, words and forms have dissolved into a shimmering, ephemeral surface.\n\nVeil belongs to a series of works called \u2018self portraits\u2019. Houshiary explains that this body of work \u2018began with the idea of the word being the manifestation of breath\u2019. She says that she \u2018set out to capture [her] breath. Breath is equivalent to life, it is energy, it is life force. Yet how can you describe breath?\u2019 (Quoted in Sculpture, pp.26-7.) Veil is the only black work in the series which otherwise comprises largely white monochromes such as Shroud, 2000 (Tate T07777). Although they combine the techniques of painting and drawing, the artist maintains that the finished works cannot easily be categorised as either paintings or drawings. Houshiary executes the work either in a slow dance around the canvas, which is laid on the floor, or by bending into it as if in prayer. Each takes five or six weeks to complete. \n\nThe title of the work refers to the black veil (chador) worn by Islamic women, a garment that has become a central issue in recent debates surrounding the role of women in Islamic societies. These issues have been addressed more directly by other female Iranian artists working in exile, such as Shirin Neshat (born 1957) but remain latent in Houshiary\u2019s work. At first glance Veil bears some resemblance to the all-black squares and rectangles of Kasimir Malevich (1878-1935) and Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967): see, for example, Reinhardt\u2019s No Title, 1964 (Tate P77814). However, the way Houshiary uses text to induce physical and optical states allied to the experience of meditation has more in common with the work of Lebanese artist Mona Hatoum (born 1952). In her 1988 video piece, Measures of Distance (Tate T07538), Hatoum uses the text of letters from her absent mother as a scrim over video footage of her mother. The juxtaposition of visual image and text evoke both the actual absence and desired presence of the mother. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nAnne Barclay Morgan, \u2018From Form to Formlessness: A Conversation with Shirazeh Houshiary\u2019, Sculpture, vol.19, no.6, July-August 2000, pp.24-9\nIsthmus: Shirazeh Houshiary, exhibition catalogue, Centre National d'Art Contemporain de Grenoble, Grenoble 1995\nTurning points: 20th century British Sculpture, exhibition catalogue, Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, Tehran 2004, pp.9-17\nAnna Bright\nFebruary 2005\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint and graphite on canvas", "date": "1999", "dimensions": "Support: 1902 x 1902 x 36 mm", "reference": "T07776", "title": "Veil", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/houshiary-veil-t07776", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07776_8.jpg", "artist": "Shirazeh Houshiary", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1955", "artistbio": "\n Iranian sculptor and installation artist, active in England. She left Iran in 1973 and studied at the Chelsea School of Art, London (1976\u20139), then was a junior fellow at Cardiff College of Art (1979\u201380). Although she settled in London and was often bracketed with a group of young British sculptors, including Anish Kapoor and Richard Deacon, her work was distinguished by the interpretation of a Persian cultural background through Western sculptural language. Her early work consisted of allusive environments and biomorphic sculptural forms, demonstrating an attempt, echoed in later work, to embody spiritual concepts physically. As it developed, her work became more autonomous, austere and concerned with materials that could symbolise a spiritual transcendence of materiality. The drawings Dancing around my Ghost (graphite and acrylic on paper, 7 parts, each 1.0\u00d71.0 m, 1992\u20133; London, Lisson Gal.) consist of delicate geometric patterns constructed with Arabic words, evoking Islamic architecture and calligraphy. The sculpture Isthmus (copper and aluminium, two parts, 3.4\u00d72.2\u00d7.9 m, 3.4\u00d75.0\u00d7.9 m, 1992: London, Lisson Gal.), an aluminium-clad box lined with copper, large enough for a person to enter, suggests spiritual transcendence in a more imposing manner. Although Houshiary derives inspiration from Sufi doctrines, such as the interdependence of unity and multiplicity, her work is intended to symbolise a universal quest for spiritual union. Conterminous with this is a criticism of the dualisms of Western philosophy, as well as the cults of individuality and originality that dominate Western art practice. \nBibliographyShirazeh Houshiary (exh. cat., Geneva, Mus.

Roberts never lost the impeccable clarity of design that his early poster-designing experience seems to have instilled in him. He thrived at the Slade, executing a tempera wall painting under Professor Tonks's supervision. He was fascinated by the achievements of Post-Impressionism and Cubism, an interest fortified in 1913 when he left the Slade and travelled in France and Italy.\nRoberts showed a sturdy independence, viewing the life around him with an almost Hogarthian eye for the antics of London's inhabitants. He was one of the list of signatories to the first issue of Blast. His gruelling experiences at the Front changed the direction of his work.\nLike the other Vorticists, Roberts returned to London with a more representational art in view. Many of his pictures of the 1920s contain acerbic and even grotesque elements, as he developed into an interpreter of city life on the street, in the cinema, at the music hall and on the dance floor. Retaining the stern architecture of his pre-war work and yet infusing it with a more robust feeling for the solidity of the human figure, Roberts treated his predominantly working-class protagonists with humour and dignity. Between 1939 and 1945 Roberts and his family lived in Oxford, and so images of punting holiday-makers replaced his former preoccupation with metropolitan life. In his later years his main outlet was the Royal Academy, where he was elected an RA in 1966 and continued to show monumental urban scenes until his death in 1980.\nBibliographyWilliam Roberts ARA (exh. cat. by R.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Alleluia was bought for the Nation under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest, following its exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1896. Along the top of the canvas, inscribed in Gothic lettering on a background of gold leaf, a Latin quotation reads: Sancti tui domine benedicent te gloriam regni tui dicent - Alleluya. The inscription is taken from Psalm xlvii: 6 and 7, which was printed in the catalogue of the 1896 Royal Academy exhibition: ' \"Sing praises to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, Sing praises, For God is King of all the earth: Sing praises with understanding\".'\n\nAlleluia is one of a number of compositions by Gotch that were painted throughout the 1890s and 1900s in the new style that the artist adopted following a visit to Italy in 1891-2. Compositions by Gotch post-1892 generally take as their focus the themes of motherhood and child development. Other examples of such work by him include, The Child Enthroned (1894), The Heir to All The Ages (1897), A Pageant of Childhood (1899, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) and Holy Motherhood (1902, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne). These works, which share a common hieratic style and draw also on the symbolism of religious ritual, caused the artist to be linked with a contemporary revival of interest in English Pre-Raphaelitism. \n\nThe composition, which draws on the visual tradition of the devotional altarpiece or reredos, was described by one critic of the 1896 Royal Academy exhibition as 'a rather powerful and rich scheme of colour, aided by a gold background' in which the figures were 'lacking spontaneity and natural movement' (Magazine of Art, 1896, p.358). In a long monographic article on Gotch written in 1910, the American critic, Charles Caffin, commented of Alleluia: 'A touch of seriousness shadows Gotch's vision. One discerns it ... in the Alleluia of the Tate Gallery, where two rows of children in dresses of damask and brocade stand in front of a gilded architectural wainscot, singing the old Latin hymn of praise to God. In this modern \"Cherub's Choir\" the artist ... has translated it into the symbolism of his own idea of childhood, which is not merely a love of childhood as a stationary aspect of life, but a step in the evolution of the individual and the race' (Caffin, p.930).\n\nIn 1896, the Windsor Magazine declared of Alleluia that: 'Almost every Eastern and Western nation is represented in the rainbow robes which clothe the children' (The Windsor Magazine, p.279, quoted in Wallace, n.pag). Gotch's reference to other nations of the world in the costumes worn by the children may, as has been suggested, refer to the 'universality of worship' (E.T Cook, A Popular Handbook to the Tate Gallery, 1898, p.211). However, Gotch had been a founding member of the Royal Colonial Society of British Artists, and such national inclusivity may also be viewed as an allusion to the colonial expansion of the British Empire. Indeed, events such as Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee held in 1897, the year after the public exhibition of Alleluia, were designed to commemorate the imperial splendour of the Empire under British rule at the height of its power.\n\nFurther reading:Charles Henry Caffin, 'A Painter of Childhood and Girlhood', Harper's Monthly Magazine, vol.59, May 1909-10, p.930Catherine Wallace, Thomas Cooper Gotch (1854-1931): 'The Last of The Pre-Raphaelites', exhibition catalogue, Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro 2001, unpaginated, illustrated in colour.Francis Greenacre and Caroline Fox, Painting in Newlyn 1880-1930, exhibition catalogue, Barbican Art Gallery, London 1985, p.177.\n\nRebecca ViragJuly 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "Exhibited 1896", "dimensions": "Support: 1333 x 1841 mm", "reference": "N01590", "title": "Alleluia", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gotch-alleluia-n01590", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01590_8.jpg", "artist": "Thomas Cooper Gotch", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1854\u20131931", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

At the Slade, Gotch became close friends with Henry Scott Tuke and Caroline Yates (fl 1880\u201396), whom he married in 1881. While studying in Paris in the early 1880s Gotch began to practise the plein-air approach later associated with the Newlyn school. \nGotch settled in Newlyn in 1887, but he continued to experiment with subjects, styles and media. Many oils and watercolours are indebted to the tonal and compositional innovations of his friend James McNeill Whistler. Portrait painting (e.g. Sir William Drake in the Morning Room, 1885; priv. col.) remained Gotch's primary source of income throughout his life. He sought a new focus for his work in Florence between 1891 and 1892, and in a series of paintings resulting from this visit, beginning with My Crown and Sceptre (1892; Sydney, A.G. NSW), he returned to allegorical genre painting. His new combination of symbolic female figures, decorative Italian textiles and the static order of early Renaissance art finally brought him recognition. Alleluia (1896; London, Tate) was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest trustees. Gotch was active in the Royal Society of British Artists and the Royal Institution. He was a founding member of the New English Art Club and the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists, serving as president between 1913\u201328.\nBibliographyA. L. Baldry: \u2018The Work of T. C.

Portraits of his favourite model, Rose Pettigrew, executed in the early 1890s, are the most relaxed and original in this genre.\nBy the beginning of the 1890s Steer was the leading follower of French Impressionism in England. However, Steer's use of Impressionist techniques was idiosyncratic and determined by his response to the form and colour of his chosen motifs. Steer extensively reworked the composition until the balance between naturalistic representation and the demands of the picture surface came close to Symbolism.\nSteer's style underwent radical change from c. 1895, when he began consciously to reassess the works of the Old Masters. In landscape painting this led him to re-examine the work of Rubens, Constable and Turner and to select his subject-matter from the august countryside of inland Britain. Between 1893 and 1911 he visited many of the favoured sites of the 18th-century picturesque tour.\nSteer began to paint in watercolour in the early 1890s, although he always regarded the medium as preliminary to his oil paintings. \nIn 1927 Steer began to lose his sight in one eye and proceeded to paint almost exclusively in watercolour.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This picture is among the most original works to have been produced in England in the first half of the eighteenth century, maintaining the intimate atmosphere of a small conversation piece in a life-size group portrait. Highmore painted it at the request of Nathaniel Oldham to commemorate a dinner party held at Oldham's home, to which he had arrived belatedly. According to the author and antiquarian, John Thomas Smith (1766-1833), who heard the story from his father, who had at one time owned the picture and was himself the godson of Mr Oldham:\n\n\n\nMr Oldham had invited three friends to dine with him at his house at Ealing; but being a famous and constant sportsman he did not arrive till they had dined; and then he found them so comfortably seated with their pipes over a bowl of negus, that he commissioned Highmore to paint the scene and desired that he might be introduced in it just as he then appeared (quoted in Einberg and Egerton 1988, p.47).\n\n\n\nMr Oldham, who has just arrived, stands at the extreme left of the painting, his arms folded over the top of the chair, his tricorn hat still on his head. He wears an expression of barely concealed amusement. In the centre, seated with his pipe and glass of negus, is a large, red-faced man, identified by Smith as a neighbouring farmer. At the right, dressed in black, is a local schoolmaster, his glassy eyed stare and slumped posture indicating that he has supped well. Between these two figures, peering out over his glass, is the third guest, Joseph Highmore, whom Oldham commissioned to paint the scene.\n\nNathaniel Oldham (active 1728-47), who had served with the British army in India, inherited a fortune, which enabled him to indulge his love of field sports and fine art. Little is known of his time in Ealing other than that he lived at Ealing House between 1728 and 1735, which was possibly the setting for this memorable dinner party. He and Highmore were close friends, one contemporary describing them as 'very intimate' (Einberg and Egerton, p.48). Highmore also painted a full-length portrait of Oldham as a huntsman, although this picture is now known only from an engraving.\n\nOldham, who was extravagant in his tastes, eventually fell into debt, apparently evading his creditors by seeking sanctuary in the court of St James. He was, however, eventually bankrupted and was imprisoned for debt in the King's Bench prison, where he is said to have died. \n\nPartly because of the unusual format of this picture, and the way in which it differs from Highmore's other works, Mr Oldham and his Guests is difficult to date precisely on stylistic grounds. Although Highmore's exact age in the picture cannot be determined, he would appear to be around fifty years old. If that were so, the picture would have been painted in the early 1740s. The picture was almost certainly painted before 1747 when Oldham's collection of prints, books and drawings were auctioned from his address at Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, either following or anticipating his bankruptcy.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nElizabeth Einberg and Judy Egerton, The Age of Hogarth.

He was articled to an attorney on 18 July 1707. Bored with his duties, he abandoned law, setting up as a portrait painter in the City of London. He read widely and mastered Brook Taylor's system of perspective (1715). In 1732 he travelled to the Low Countries to study works by Rubens and van Dyck, and two years later he went to Paris. In the following years he secured commissions from the royal family, such as Queen Caroline of Ansbach (c. 1735; London, Hampton Court, Royal Col.).\nIn the 1740s Highmore's work was increasingly aimed at a middle-class clientele, his popularity with whom was in part due to his ability to capture a likeness in one sitting and to create an informal composition. This can be seen in his conversation pieces. His portraits of An Unknown Man with a Musket (1745; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam) and Samuel Richardson (1747; replica London, N.P.G.) are examples of the faithful likeness and unpretentious format sought by such sitters. \nHe sold the contents of his studio in 1762 and retired to Canterbury with his daughter and son-in-law. In retirement he pursued a second career, that of a writer, which he had begun in 1754 with a critical examination of Rubens's ceiling decorations in the Banqueting Hall, London.He also wrote a book on Brook Taylor's theory of perspective (1763), and his collection of moral essays (1766) included a consideration of why artists were not the only proper judges of art. \nBibliographyObituary, Gent.

He was a self-taught painter but attended the acad\u00e9mies libres in Paris as a young man. He was a member of the art communities of Newlyn in Cornwall (1919\u201320), Paris (1921\u20136) and London (1926\u201339). Although he had experimented with abstraction c. 1922, he resigned from the society when it moved away from representation. Between 1937 and c. 1975 Morris and Lett-Haines directed the distinctly non-academic East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing; in 1940 the school was moved to Morris's home at Benton End, Hadleigh, Suffolk, where he also cultivated a garden and bred irises.\nMorris's paintings combine a strong sense of colour with pictorial economy, often with unusual tactility. Conveyed with great immediacy, a painting's principal motif is usually juxtaposed boldly with a contrasting background. His subjects include still-lifes and flower paintings, such as Iris Seedlings (1943; London, Tate); landscapes and townscapes, both local and from his wide travels; animals and birds, such as Greenland Falcon (1928; Belfast, Ulster Mus.). Some of his most arresting works are his penetrating portraits, for example that of his student Lucian Freud (1940; London, Tate). The attitudes implied by his paintings range from tenderness to satire. Morris, averse to English tastefulness, seemed at times closer to the sensibility of the Neue Sachlichkeit. His paintings include protests against prudery, environmental pollution and also hypocrisy, as in the Entry of Moral Turpitude into New York Harbour (1926; priv. col., see exh. cat. 1984, no. 31).\nBibliographyCedric Morris (exh. cat. by R.

In 1960 she took part in the Situation exhibition at the RBA Galleries in London but, unlike most of her colleagues, who worked in a cool hard-edge style, she painted in a free tachist manner inspired in part by photographs of Jackson Pollock working on the floor. From 1964 to 1976 she worked in acrylic, producing powdery, close-toned canvases that were similar in their textures to the contemporary work of the Americans Jules Olitski and Larry Poons.\nIn 1977 Ayres changed over to oil paint, manipulating it like strands of clay to build up thick iridescent surfaces where colours seem to merge into each other or waft outwards, as in Orlando furioso (1977\u20139; AC England). While such painting may evoke the shimmering floral confusion of late Monets, the directness of the handling \u2013 often the paint is pressed into place by hand \u2013 ensures a strong physical presence. From the late 1970s, Ayres's consistently lyrical abstract paintings began to emphasise the decorative role of the internal forms within simple formats, often square or circular in shape. \nBibliographyG.

He had almost no academic training as an artist. From 1948 to 1951 he produced Surrealistic drawings representing underwater scenes and mystical forms, rendering these fantastic images in pencil as a densely worked surface. Deeply suspicious of rationality, he investigated the potential of dreams, madness and the subconscious; to these ends he co-founded the Hundsgruppe under the influence of French Surrealism in 1950.\nHe began to turn away from fantastic Surrealism. From 1951 to 1954 he worked on a series entitled Blind Drawings (e.g. 1952; see 1988 exh. cat., p. 27), in which he studied optical disintegration and the destruction of form, replacing pictorial composition and illusion with the immediacy of accidentally encountered textures. From 1953 to 1965 he devoted himself principally to a series of Overpaintings, in which he obliterated his early expressive drawings or pictures by friends with whose work he was in sympathy, to produce almost monochrome paintings dominated by black or red. \nFrom 1956 Rainer became concerned with religious theories and practices, particularly in a group of paintings dominated by cruciform shapes. The interest in extreme emotional states hinted at in such works became even more pronounced in 1963, when he began to collect paintings by the insane, and in 1964, when he experimented with hallucinogenic drugs. \nFrom the mid 1970s Rainer reworked photographs on a variety of subjects. Constantly adding to his repertory of images Rainer continued to exploit the interaction of intellectual meditation and bodily expression.\nBibliographyO.

His etchings include landscapes in the tradition of Rembrandt, pastoral themes indebted to Giorgione and macabre genre subjects, marked by a sense of tension and suspended animation. He also etched 150 portraits of leading artistic and literary figures. The commitment to realism and psychological intensity that characterises the best of Strangss etched work is also evident in the paintings that dominated the latter half of his career. The influence of the Belgian and French Symbolists' work and Strang's growing confidence in the handling of colour combined in his mature style with a linear clarity and schematic colouring that is best seen in such works as Bank Holiday (1912; London, Tate). His oil portraits, for example Vita Sackville-West as Lady In a Red Hat (1918; Glasgow, A.G. &amp; Mus.), are strikingly potent images of their time.

It was painted in his studio in Belsize Park the year before his death, when he already knew he was suffering from cancer.\n\nThe composition was taken precisely from a small, undated, pencil drawing, 6 1/2 \u00d7 8 ins. The artist gave this to Professor Ball and Dr. Hargreaves when they jointly purchased the painting, and told them it was made much earlier. They date it on grounds of style to about 1960\u20132, and it was inscribed for them on the mount by the artist \u2018To John and Gordon - March 1976 - Keith Vaughan - 9th Assembly of Figures\u2019. The drawing is heavily worked, with many altered placings for the figures before it was finally shaded over. The main differences in the painting are that the central figure, painted dark blue, is barely visible in the drawing, and there is no suggestion of a landscape at the left, visible in the drawing as two ellipse shapes.\n\nIt is likely that this drawing was itself also connected to the verse from Baudelaire which is included in the title of the painting, since the artist confirmed to Professor Ball that the right hand hanging figure is that of the verse:\n\n\nPerched on their provender, ferocious birds\nwere ravaging the ripe corpse hanging there.\n\n\nHe also identified the figure at the lower left, cut off by the frame, as himself pictured as an observer. The second verse, written in full on the reverse of the painting, also expresses disillusion with the ideal:\n\n\nWhat is that dreary island - the black one there?\nCyth\u00e9ra, someone says, the one in the song\ninsipid Eldorado of good old boys:\nit isn't much of a place, as you can see\n(from Charles Baudelaire, Les Fleurs du Mal,\ntranslated by Richard Howard, 1982)\n\n\nDespite the reference to old age Vaughan had already used this verse for a drawing of 1942, not connected with the \u2018Ninth Assembly\u2019, titled \u2018Voyage \u00e0 Cyth\u00e8re\u2019 and inscribed \u2018Quelle est cette Triste Isle\u2019 (exhibited The British Neo-Romantics, Fischer Fine Art, July\u2013August 1983 (67)). He was also in 1942\u20133 making drawings from Rimbaud's Une Saison en Enfer.

He abandoned a career in advertising in 1939 to pursue painting. From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Pioneer Corps. His drawings of army life, however, such as Breakfast in the Marquee (1942; see Vaughan, p. 49), attracted attention and he entered the circle of Peter Watson in London. From 1946 to 1952 he shared a studio with John Minton. As a younger generation Neo-Romantic he was heavily influenced by Graham Sutherland, Henry Moore and William Blake. During the 1950s Paul C\u00e9zanne and Henri Matisse were major influences, but most important was that of Nicolas De Stael, who enabled him to reconcile figurative and abstract elements. He was essentially a painter of figure compositions that attempted to balance male nudes with abstract environments, exemplified by his nine Assemblies begun in 1952.\nAfter 1945 Vaughan travelled in the Mediterranean, North Africa, Mexico and the USA, where he was resident artist at Iowa State University in 1959. He taught in London at Camberwell School of Art (1946\u20138) and the Central School of Arts and Crafts (1948\u201357) and was a visiting teacher at the Slade School of Fine Art (1959\u201377). His remarkable journal (1939\u201377), inspired by Andr\u00e9 Gide, reveals the tension in his life and work between intellectual puritanism and unrepressed sensuality. His work can be regarded as an expression of his feelings about the male body.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This painting depicts a group of kilns for firing clay, a chapel and an array of terraced houses dotted about in the distance. It takes its title from the name given to a group of towns in the region of Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nThe painting dates from the years when Trevelyan was allied to the left wing Mass Observation group. Founded in 1937 by the anthropologist Tom Harrisson (1911-76) and the writer Charles Madge (1912-96), Mass Observation was an anthropological study of the British working class. It was a purely information gathering project intended to accumulate a mass of data for future generations to analyse.\n\nFor the duration of the survey, Harrisson lived in Bolton, a town he referred to as 'Worktown'. From there he and Madge commissioned volunteers to record secretly the daily activities and conversations of working people. Harrisson himself took a job in a cotton mill, while the artist Humphrey Jennings (1907-50) filmed millers at work. In addition to these covert operations, some of the observed were persuaded to keep detailed diaries of their day to day existence. All of this information was collated and now forms the Mass Observation archive at Sussex University.\n\nIn the summer of 1937 Harrisson invited Trevelyan and Michael Wickham, a communist and artist, to visit Bolton and paint street scenes. The following spring William Coldstream and Graham Bell joined the project as well. Once the paintings were complete photographs were made of them and then, in an attempt to gauge popular taste, passers-by were asked for their opinions of the images. From this research it was hoped an aesthetic would emerge that was accessible to working class people and acceptable to vanguard artists. Harrisson reported that all the paintings were criticised for 'lack of life' (undated letter from Harrisson to Trevelyan, Trevelyan Archive, Trinity College Library, Cambridge, box 4). \n\nTrevelyan spent much of his time in Bolton photographing street life and making collages of industrial scenes. It was only after visiting the Potteries in 1938 that he began to make paintings. In an unpublished manuscript Trevelyan described the area as 'a landscape full of drama and pathos, very much after my own heart\u2026. Human beings seemed to creep about almost apologetically among the man made disasters\u2026. I found this world of pyrotechnics and smoke most inspiring as a painter' (Trevelyan Archive, box 8). Despite Harrisson's categorisation of Trevelyan as a 'leading exponent of the Surrealist school' (Harrisson, 'What They Think in Worktown', The Listener, 25 August 1938, p.398), the paintings he made in The Potteries mark a departure from his earlier work. Instead of the fantastical imagery of Base Wall (Tate T05798) for example, The Potteries is a stylised record of a remembered scene. Its na\u00efve figuration is reminiscent both of Christopher Wood (1901-30) and to a lesser extent Alfred Wallis (1855-1942). The use of this primitive idiom to depict working class life is consistent with the understanding of labourers as exotic, unsophisticated innocents that underpinned Mass Observation attitudes. In an undated letter to Trevelyan, Harrisson discussed an exhibition about Bolton in which he suggested they 'reconstruct an actual part of a street and the graphitti [sic] of one lavatory wall\u2026Also serve bolton meals with readings aloud on how to eat them. Fish and chips frying continually, and soot falling constantly' (Trevelyan Archive, box 4).\n\nThe Potteries was probably worked up in his studio or hotel room from pen and ink drawings made on site. The painting was discovered in 1995 by the artist Mary Fedden (b.1915), Trevelyan's widow, among a cache of pictures at her home.\n\nFurther reading:Julian Trevelyan, Indigo Days: The art and memoirs of Julian Trevelyan, London 1957The Imaginative Impulse: Julian Trevelyan 1910-88, exhibition catalogue, Bohun Gallery, London 1998Suzanne Marston, Julian Trevelyan: 'To Break a Butterfly on a Wheel', unpublished MA report, Courtauld Institute of Art, London 1993\n\nToby TrevesDecember 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1938", "dimensions": "Support: 604 x 735 mm", "reference": "T07040", "title": "The Potteries", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/trevelyan-the-potteries-t07040", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07040_8.jpg", "artist": "Julian Trevelyan", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1910\u20131988", "artistbio": "\n Julian TREVELYAN b. 1910\n\nPainter and engraver of Surrealist and Expressionist tendencies.

Maclise was a central figure in this early phase of the Irish revival, and maintained an interest in Irish subject-matter throughout his career. \nTo further his career, Maclise travelled to London in 1827 and entered the Royal Academy in 1828. He was successful as a student and left with the gold medal for history painting in 1831. During the 1830s he developed a form of historical genre painting with a strongly literary flavour. Maclise's Romantic medievalism and Tory nostalgia for \u2018Young England'. The theatre, and especially Shakespeare, was a lifelong interest of Maclise. \nMaclise's mature style developed during the 1840s under the influence of continental art. The central event of Maclise's career was his commission to paint some of the mural decorations in the Houses of Parliament. Maclise became imbued with the high-minded ideals and style of contemporary German narrative art, which he related to themes that had personal meaning for him.\nHis large narrative subjects of the 1850s culminated in the cartoon of the Meeting of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher for the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster, which drew great acclaim when it was exhibited there in 1859. He completed the Meeting of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher in 1861 and its companion, the Death of Nelson, in 1865. Both of these gigantic paintings have all the factual historical detail so esteemed by Victorian critics and public. Maclise's personality is elusive; he was charming and genial although shy, but became withdrawn and depressed in later life.\nBibliographyW. J.

Among Utrillo's other paintings of the Place du Tertre there is one, made at least twenty years later (P\u00e9trid\u00e8s No.1406, as painted c.1932), which is so similar that both seem to have been done from the same picture postcard. The viewpoint is identical and the trees are in the same wintry, leafless state, but the later picture takes in a little more of the view at the top and the treatment is more precise and detailed. Certain minor differences suggest that Utrillo made a few compositional adjustments in painting the present work, for example by widening the low building second from left, so that it almost blocks off the side street, but in the later version followed his model more literally.\n\nTabarant relates that the collector Libaude (who took the greater part of Utrillo's production from 1909 to 1914) objected to Utrillo's untidy handwriting and that many of his pictures were signed for him by his mother Suzanne Valadon.

She first became known as a book illustrator and printmaker, producing mainly lithographs and wood-engravings. Her mature work as a painter followed her first visit to Paris (1920), when she began to paint in a simplified, Post-Impressionist style.

Her work began in 1929 to be abstract, with lines and shapes floating in a cloudy, atmospheric space, as in Curves and Circles (1930; London, Tate), although she also painted a few Masson-like semi-Surrealist compositions. In 1934 she joined the Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation group, and most of her later paintings such as Forms on Grey (1935; London, Tate) were more classical, with clear-cut forms, sometimes like vases, against a uniform background. Her most original contributions to the abstract movement, however, were probably the Lines in Space that she began in 1936: shallow wooden boxes with a spatial network of threads or curving wires, for example Lines in Space No. 16 (1951; Basle, Kstmus.).

He had several times before depicted men with fish, notably in the etching, \u2018Self Portrait with Fish\u2019, 1978, in which a large fish lies along the bare feet of the standing figure. The artist said in conversation (17 April 1986) that the origin of the \u2018Water Bearer\u2019 was his chance sight of an illustration of a classical sculpture of the same subject. He made several preparatory drawings, including a complete study in coloured chalks (24 \u00d7 11\", signed and dated 1981, Josh Baer Gallery, New York); the colours in this are less bright, notably lacking the strong red of the fish's tail. The subject, he said, was its title, and both were invented together: since the fish lives in water the man, by association, is a water bearer.\n\nChia's subjects are often men or boys travelling, and usually also enacting some role. An essay by Anne Seymour based on conversations with the artist was published by the d'Offay and Sperone Galleries for the London exhibition of 1981 which included the \u2018Water Bearer\u2019. She describes the metaphorical character of these subjects:\n\nThis perhaps gives substance to the feeling one has, that the male figures in Chia's pictures are searching for something, or perhaps that they are pilgrims of a sort, for they often seem bound on some unidentified mission. They are, the artist points out, figures born of painting and thus possessed of a strong code of morals and justice, for the rules of painting are strict and the responsibilities heavy. He sees them as having something in common with heroes and with monks, and their moment of action in his painting as being their moment of ecstasy. Embodying thus the moral lessons of painting they become part of man's great pursuit of the absolute and their existence a physical step towards mystery.\n\nThe boy carrying a fish recalls the story of Tobias in the Apocrypha (Tobit 6, vv. 2\u20133), who was told by an angel to take a large fish with him on his journey to find a bride. The story was often painted during the Italian Renaissance, although not in the same way. There is no specific connection to Chia's painting, but he confirmed that the subject was relevant to it, as part of the same family of images.\n\nThe painting is signed and dated on the reverse of the canvas with an outline of a fish saying, in a balloon, \u2018Sandro Chia 1981\u2019.

In the late 1970s he returned to painting and quickly established himself as a major artist of the movement in Italian figurative painting known as the Transavanguardia.

In Water Bearer (oil and pastel on canvas, 2.07\u00d71.70 m, 1981; London, Tate) and related paintings, larger-than-life, heroic male figures imbued with an enigmatic sense of mission are Chia's main protagonists as manifestations of his own identity; he explored similar imagery not only in drawings and prints (e.g. an etching published in 1983 that reversed the composition of Water Bearer, see 1984 exh. cat., p. 46) but also in sculptures cast in bronze and sometimes exuberantly painted in vivid colours, as in Man with Ram (h. 1.52 m, 1983; priv. col., see Hannover exh. cat., pp. 143\u20134).\nBibliographySandro Chia (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The Wine Press is one of Spencer Stanhope's early works painted during his association with members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and before he turned to painting allegories inspired by the Italian Renaissance in the manner of Edward Burne-Jones (1833-98). Described by Stanhope's niece, Anna Maria Wilhelmina Stirling, as 'perhaps the finest work he ever executed', The Wine Press had an unusual origin according to Stirling, who claims that: 'It was during a visit to Varennes in his youth that, watching the treading of the winepress by the French peasants, he evolved this design' (Stirling, p.335). Stanhope, who was for a time a pupil of the artist G.F. Watts (1817-1904), completed The Wine Press in 1864, the year of Watts's marriage to the young actress Ellen Terry (1848-1928). Stirling recalls that as Stanhope 'was working at it in Watts' (sic) studio, Ellen Terry, the bride, came into the room and placed herself in the attitude represented by the figure in the picture' (Stirling, p.335). \n\nThe Biblical subject derives from the lines inscribed on the frame, 'I have trodden the winepress alone', which are taken from the Old Testment book of Isaiah 63:3 : 'I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment'. The historian, George P. Landow has identified the biblical image of the winepress with the notion of divine punishment, when God threatens mankind with death. In Isaiah 63:3, the Lord is angry 'because His people have not helped in the battle against evil' (George P. Landow, Victorian Types, Victorian Shadows, Biblical Typology in Victorian Literature, Art and Thought, London 1980, pp.182-3). The Wine Press may be understood as an example of Biblical typology, a form of symbolism, revived in the nineteenth century, in which divinely intended prefigurements of Christ's passion and Crucifixion were identifiable in the events of the Old Testament. Biblical typology was frequently employed in Pre-Raphaelite painting. Landow points out that in the Old Testament, the suffering of Christ on the cross is conveyed in the image of treading the winepress: 'Christ, who is both victim and conqueror, treads the winepress and is crushed by it.' (Landow, p.183). \n\nBiblical typology is most evident in the work of Henry Holman Hunt (1827-1910), whose The Shadow of Death (1870-3, Manchester City Art Galleries), in which Christ the carpenter holds up his arms in the attitude of crucifixion, is comparable with the pose of Christ in Stanhope's painting as he works the machinery of the winepress. Comparisons were made by contemporaries between Stanhope's The Wine Press and an earlier painting by Holman Hunt, The Light of the World (1851-3, Keble College, Oxford). Both works portray Christ in his offices as prophet, priest and king in their representation of the jewelled crown, the 'ehpod' or surplice worn by the Jewish High Priest, which is lined with crimson, and the white undergarment representing the spotless humanity of Christ. However, Stirling denied any suggestion that her uncle had been influenced by Hunt's representation of Christ in The Light of the World, declaring that 'the resemblance which critics profess to discover between the two was disclaimed by Holman Hunt himself.' (Stirling, p.335). The Wine Press was later also compared with the work of Simeon Solomon by one reviewer when it was shown at a retrospective exhibition of Stanhope's work at the Carfax Gallery, London in 1909 (Art Journal, 1909, p.158). Simeon Solomon (1840-1905) was a Jewish artist who painted biblical subjects, often from the books of the Old Testament and who was associated, like Stanhope, with the Pre-Raphaelite circle surrounding Rossetti. The art historians Martin Harrison and Bill Waters have suggested that the 'boxed-in space' of a contemporaneous work by Burne-Jones, The Merciful Knight (1863, Birmingham City Museums and Art Gallery) may have influenced the composition of The Wine Press (Harrison and Waters, p.72). Burne-Jones was making sketches for the landscape background in The Merciful Knight during a visit to Stanhope's house in Cobham, Surrey, while Stanhope was at work on The Wine Press. \n\nAnother version of The Wine Press, painted on paper in watercolour, gouache and gold paint and which pre-dates the Tate oil painting, is in the Lanigan Collection, Canada. This work, The Wine Press (c.1863-4), was bought by George Rae of Birkenhead, an industrialist and well-known collector of Pre-Raphaelite painting. Although the composition is essentially the same, the earlier version is simpler in design and does not possess the fine detail and hard outlines of the Tate work. \n\nFurther reading:A.M.W.

The second son of Yorkshire landed gentry, he was educated at Rugby and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1850 he studied in London with G. F. Watts, through whom he entered the artistic circle at Little Holland House, where he met D. G. Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones.Stanhope's close friendship with Burne-Jones proved a more decisive influence on his work that, in the 1860s, consisted of dreamlike poetic and mythological subjects often set in quaint, enclosed spaces, as in I Have Trod the Winepress Alone (c. 1864; London, Tate).\nStanhope married in 1859 and moved to Sandroyd, a house near Cobham, Surrey, designed for him by Philip Webb in 1860, but because of severe asthma he wintered abroad from 1865 and in 1880 moved permanently to the Villa Nuti, Bellosguardo, near Florence. Deeply influenced by Italian art, he had his frames made in gilt gesso by Florentine craftsmen and was one of the first British artists to revive tempera painting, adopting it at least as early as 1877 in Eve Tempted (exh. London, Grosvenor Gal. 1877; Manchester, C.A.G.). His later work, marked by strong, frieze-like compositions of Quattrocento-style figures painted in glowing colours, is exemplified in the 12 frescoed panels of ministrations of angels (1872\u20139; reworked 1880s) at Marlborough College Chapel, Wilts, painted at the suggestion of the architect G. F. Bodley, with whom he was also associated at the Anglican Church, Florence.BibliographyR. Spencer Stanhope (exh. cat., intro. W. de Morgan; London, Carfax Gal., 1909)A. M. W.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nThis large canvas is made up of thick streaks of colourful oil paint \u2013 in particular blue, yellow and green \u2013 which have been dripped, poured and smudged over a red ground in a seemingly frenzied manner. Four lines of text \u2013 \u2018BLIND FAIL\u2019, \u2018ATAXIA\u2019, \u2018AIDS IS FUN\u2019 and \u2018LETS FUCK\u2019 \u2013 have been inscribed into the wet paint surface by hand. The disorderly composition of the painting, and the fact that the words are written into the paint, rather than rendered in a different colour, make them hard to distinguish from the saturated backdrop, although the letters of the two central phrases, which make up the title, are larger and more prominently inscribed.\nThe slogans included in Ataxia \u2013 Aids is Fun reflect the openness, irony and defiance that characterised British artist and film-maker Derek Jarman\u2019s public statements after he was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1986. Ataxia is a neurological condition that causes loss of balance and co-ordination. In his diary entry for 12 June 1993, the month in which he completed this painting, Jarman wrote, \u2018I have acquired a new disability, ataxia, which I call \u201cwobble\u201d \u2013 the HIV is attacking my nervous system so my wobble is in fact a bit of a stagger\u2019 (Jarman 2001, p.360). At this time Jarman was also suffering from reduced eyesight and his body continued to deteriorate until he finally succumbed to an AIDS-related illness in February 1994. For Jarman, raising awareness of the realities of his condition and maintaining a degree of dark humour about it were important political gestures in light of the homophobic stigma surrounding AIDS in contemporary society.\nAlthough Jarman maintained a studio at his cottage in Dungeness in Kent, where he lived between 1987 and 1994, Ataxia \u2013 Aids is Fun was made in the studios owned by his dealer Richard Salmon in Kensington, London. Jarman\u2019s working methods in the final years of his life were particularly intense, as he painted very quickly (and with the help of a small team of assistants), before his ill health necessitated periods of recovery.\nJarman trained as a painter at the Slade School of Fine Art in London (1963\u20137) and continued to paint throughout his life, although from the 1970s onwards he devoted the majority of his attention to film-making. After a period in the mid-1980s in which he mainly composed collages, he returned to painting in 1989. Between 1990 and 1992 he completed a series titled Queer, which consists of forty-four paintings that examine the representation of homosexuality and AIDS in the media.\n\nAtaxia \u2013 Aids is Fun is one of seventeen paintings completed in 1993 that contain confrontational and comic statements inscribed into colourful patterns of paint (see, for example, Arse Injected Death Syndrome 1993 and Dead Sexy 1993). Discussing these works with the writer Ken Butler in 1993, Jarman remarked, \u2018I want to release some of the anger which everyone with HIV feels ... The actual physicality of painting will release the violence in me\u2019 (quoted in Whitworth Art Gallery 1994, pp.12\u201314). As the art critic Stuart Morgan later observed, \u2018Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of these paintings is their incongruity. Despite the proximity to death, a frantic party atmosphere is conjured up\u2019 (Stuart Morgan, \u2018Borrowed Time\u2019, in Wollen 1996, p.119).\nThe diverse range of colours that feature in Jarman\u2019s last paintings can be contrasted with his final feature film Blue, which premiered at the Venice Biennale in June 1993. In Blue a single frame of deep blue inspired by the hue patented by the French artist Yves Klein (see IKB 79 1959, Tate T01513) is projected onto the screen while a series of actors recite a poetic text exploring Jarman\u2019s medical condition, and his failing eyesight in particular.\nThe first work by Jarman to be acquired by Tate, Ataxia \u2013 Aids is Fun was presented in memory of Adrian Ward-Jackson (1950\u201391), a former art dealer and governor at the Royal Ballet in London who died of AIDS, and whose brother, Nicholas Ward-Jackson, co-wrote the script for Jarman\u2019s film Caravaggio (1986). During a lunch held at the Tate Gallery on 16 November 1993 to mark the acquisition of this work, the artist Richard Hamilton took a series of Polaroid photographs of Jarman standing in front of Ataxia \u2013 Aids is Fun. These photographs formed the basis of Hamilton\u2019s painted portrait Derek Jarman 1994. Tate holds Hamilton\u2019s digital print Derek Jarman 1996\u20137 (Tate P78013), which also stems from this event.\n\nAtaxia \u2013 Aids is Fun was first displayed at the Tate Gallery in 1994 to mark Jarman\u2019s death.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDerek Jarman: Evil Queen, exhibition catalogue, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester 1994, reproduced p.19.Roger Wollen (ed.), Derek Jarman: A Portrait, London 1996.Derek Jarman, Smiling in Slow Motion: Diaries, 1991\u201394, London 2001.\nRichard MartinMarch 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1993", "dimensions": "Support: 2515 x 1790 x 36 mm", "reference": "T06768", "title": "Ataxia - Aids is Fun", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/jarman-ataxia-aids-is-fun-t06768", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06768_8.jpg", "artist": "Derek Jarman", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1942\u20131994", "artistbio": "\n English filmmaker, theatre designer, writer and painter. He exhibited widely after his graduation. Although he continued painting sporadically during the 1970s, his energies were principally directed in this decade toward filmmaking and theatre design. His first full-length feature, Sebastiane, was released in 1976. After establishing an international reputation as a film director, Jarman continued painting, making his first \u2018black' painting in 1980, by scratching through a layer of black in order to uncover selectively a ground of gold leaf. Jarman's 1984 retrospective (London, ICA) demonstrated his increasingly political stance, characterised by an anti-Thatcherism and a preoccupation with social disintegration, which culminated in his 1987 film The Last of England. He was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1986, primarily for his achievements as a filmmaker, and in particular for Caravaggio. The relationship between film and painting continued to be central to Jarman's work; the non-narrative flow of imagery and improvisatory collage-like quality of his films was more suggestive of a painterly than a cinematic sensibility.\nJarman was diagnosed as HIV-positive in December 1986. His last set of paintings were highly coloured works in which a word or slogan was daubed across an effusively scraped and splattered ground, again dealing with aspects of his illness. The violence and anger of these paintings contrasts with the serenity of his final film, Blue (1994). Made when he was virtually blind, it consisted solely of a monochrome blue screen, with a soundtrack of voice and music. \nBibliographyThe Exhibition of Derek Jarman: Luminous Darkness (exh. cat., Tokyo, Tokyo Creative '90 Temporary Mus., 1990)Queer (exh. cat., Manchester City A.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In this oil painting, which measures over one metre in length, a naked female figure, wearing only knee-length white socks and red slippers, lies awkwardly on a chaise longue in a starkly furnished room. Her head, with eyes closed, lolls over the right arm of the chair, allowing her dark hair to hang loosely. The girl\u2019s stiffened right arm stretches towards the floor and, with her left arm raised, her body creates a cruciform shape. Painted in muted and earthy colours, the room is lit from the right, as if from an unseen window. Her elongated torso and thighs are bathed in light but her face and the depths of the room remain in semi-darkness. The figure\u2019s closed eyes and revealing and vulnerable pose cast the viewer as a voyeur.\n\nNude on a Chaise Longue is one of a group of paintings depicting the private worlds of day-time reverie and sleep that were amongst Balthus\u2019s preferred themes, especially during the 1940s and early 1950s. In these works, a female figure, who is lit from the right, reclines on a chair or couch positioned on the left of the composition. For example, in the slightly earlier work The Week of Four Thursdays (La Semaine des quatre jeudis) 1949 (The Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Poughkeepsie), a young girl dressed in a robe or nightdress lies back in a chair and leans her head over its arm so that her hair is loose. With her raised left arm she strokes the cheek of a cat. The title refers to school holidays and suggests relaxation, and the room, which is painted in predominantly yellow tones, is suffused with a bright light from a window on the right. A later work, The Room (La Chambre) 1952\u20134 (private collection), which measures 2.7 metres by over 3 metres, is a significantly larger work than The Week of Four Thursdays and Nude on a Chaise Longue. In this painting, the dramatic contrast of light and dark and the inclusion of a menacing second figure on the right, who pulls back the curtain at the window, create a sinister mood akin to that produced in T12614.\n\nT12614 and The Room are related to a drawing Balthus made in 1949 (reproduced in Clair, p.307), in which he experimented with the position of the reclining nude. Whilst the drawing includes the window and second figure that would appear in The Room, the final position of the nude corresponds with the figure in Nude on a Chaise Longue (Clair, p.306). However, in T12614, Balthus exchanged the upholstered day bed of the drawing into a stiff, wooden chaise longue, heightening the contrast between the girl\u2019s body and the surface it touches.\n\nThe chiaroscuro lighting effects in this work are reminiscent of the art of some seventeenth-century painters, such as Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610) and Rembrandt van Rijn (1606\u201369). Its erotic and haunting atmosphere suggest the Gothic qualities of images including The Nightmare 1781 (Detroit Institute of Arts) by Henry Fuseli (1741\u20131845) in which the sleeping female figure\u2019s distorted and helpless posture help to indicate the oppressiveness of her dream.\n\nThe model for Nude on a Chaise Longue may have been Laurence Bataille (1930\u201386), the artist\u2019s companion in the late 1940s to early 1950s, whom Balthus met when she was seventeen. It is likely that Balthus painted the work in Paris and kept it there in his studio at the cour de Rohan, close to boulevard Saint-Germain. In January 1951 he sold it to his dealer Pierre Matisse (1900\u201389).\n\nFurther reading:\nJean Clair (ed.), Balthus, London 2001, reproduced p.306.\nSabine Rewald, \u2018In the Mood of the Old Masters\u2019, Tate ETC, no.13, Summer 2008, pp.60\u20131, reproduced p.61.\nAndrew Wilson (ed.), The Simon Sainsbury Bequest to Tate and the National Gallery, London 2008, reproduced p.89.\n\nAlice Sanger\nOctober 2010 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1950", "dimensions": "Support: 723 x 918 x 19 mm", "reference": "T12614", "title": "Nude on a Chaise Longue", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/klossowski-de-rola-nude-on-a-chaise-longue-t12614", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12614_8.jpg", "artist": "Balthus (Balthasar Klossowski de Rola)", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1908\u20132001", "artistbio": "\n Balthus born 1908French painter of figures and landscapes, and stage designer.

He found confirmation for his ideas in Jorn's work, which was more advanced in its development. As a result fantastic animals appeared in his work from 1946.

Constant set forth his ideas in a manifesto, published in the first issue of the periodical Reflex (1948). \nConstant's primitivistic work of the Cobra period (1948\u201351) was based primarily on children's drawings.

She painted backstage during the Diaghilev ballet's seasons in London and took lessons at Tillers Dancing Academy in St Martin's Lane in order to draw there; she also travelled with the Mills and Carmos Circus.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nPaper Cup is a large-scale, multi-layered work on canvas that combines geometric abstraction derived from a collage of lined paper segments, with hand-drawn representational elements. It is part of artist Ellen Gallagher\u2019s first mature body of work from the mid-1990s. The artist covered the entire surface of the painting\u2019s stretched cotton canvas support with eighty-four horizontal sheets of yellow writing paper, arranged in twelve rows of seven pieces each. In layering the canvas with these small sheets of paper, the artist introduced a degree of imperfection to the work, with variations in the size of individual sheets and areas of overlap producing an irregular grid that is not wholly rectilinear. The pieces of writing paper were glued when wet onto the canvas surface, which accounts for the wrinkled surface quality. This gridded paper collage is then overlaid with a repetitive, biomorphic design drawn by hand in blue ink, which at close range is revealed to reference a racist and outdated minstrelsy idea of blackface physiognomy: a miniscule pair of rubbery lips, repeated thousands of times and loosely following the lines of the paper. \nAt over two metres tall the painting creates an impact that is suggestive of the grandeur of mid-century American abstract expressionist and colour field paintings, while also setting up a juxtaposition of scale with the tiny individual \u2018lips\u2019 elements. The artist has commented on this issue of scale within her large, carefully mapped surfaces, explaining: \n\nThe idea of the gigantic is not always about a map \u2026 The scale is also about a kind of focus and humiliation. As if you\u2019re watching something that is too awful. There is an anti-spectacularity and humbleness in the labor of the work \u2013 it\u2019s hard to feel as if you ever have a good day\u2019s work as so little is achieved every day.\n(Quoted in Morgan 2001, p.23.) \n\nThe results of this time-consuming, humble work are the many pairs of \u2018lips\u2019. In places they are lopsided, drawn in double, blotted or stained with excess ink. They do not fill the picture plane. Towards the right side of the canvas edge the ink drawing trails off, resulting in an irregular blank space: a margin of two slim yellow triangles of blank writing paper. After laboriously inscribing this miniature parade of unsettling and grotesquely comic symbols in ink, Gallagher sealed the collaged painting with a coat of clear varnish, excess deposits of which are visible in the top right corner. \nThe artist has discussed a particular quality of the stationary papers she has used in works including Paper Cup, revealing that: \n\nThe paper itself, it\u2019s not archival. It\u2019s archival in the sense of historical but it\u2019s not a fine-art material. It will yellow and darken with time, so no matter what it resists me in that way. No matter how I may try to build it into forms, or arc it, or cut it, it will darken and yellow, which I like. It has its own relationship to time. \n(Quoted in PBS Art:21, http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/gallagher/clip1.html, accessed 3 September 2010.) \n\nThis unavoidable process of material ageing emphasises the meditative temporal qualities that Gallagher builds into her delicately handmade paintings. The curator and writer Claire Doherty has considered the conceptual and material tensions of works such as Paper Cup, writing:\n\nThough Gallagher\u2019s canvases are described as paintings, on closer inspection they reveal themselves as aggregations of materials. The ink, pencil and penmanship paper recall the process by which handwriting is learned. In this process the hand is literally trained to conform in order that communication may be scripted. The parallel lines act as the boundaries which contain language. Similarly the lines of this penmanship paper also resemble the staves of a musical score. \n(Doherty 1998, p.9.)\n\nBy creating a grid structure and working with a formal vocabulary that alludes to the geometry and seriality of 1960s minimalism when viewed from afar, Paper Cup cloaks its socio-political referents in the guise of art-historical reminiscences, only to subvert that safe heritage upon closer examination of the painting surface. The curator Roxana Marcoci has observed of this process of covertly embedding racial signifiers that: \u2018By inserting these provocative snippets on grade-school paper, Gallagher turns the whitewashed Minimalist grid of artists such as Agnes Martin into a \u201cprison house of race talk.\u201d\u2019 (Marcoci 2007, p.18.) Complicating the legacy of minimalism, Gallagher opens up its sublime abstraction to a powerful and unsavoury current of American history. \n\nFurther reading\nClaire Doherty, Ellen Gallagher, exhibition catalogue, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham 1998.Jessica Morgan (ed.), Ellen Gallagher, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Art Boston 2001, reproduced p.59.

She has Irish and African American origins, which have shaped the texture and subject matter of her practice. Sources include the vaudeville tradition of black minstrels, science fiction and advertising targeted at African Americans.\n\nGallagher has relied on the repetition and revision of minimalist structures since her early career; the subtle shifts and repetitions in the writing of Gertrude Stein have long been an influence, along with the sublime paintings of Agnes Martin. Minimalist geometry is used as an empty shell into which controversial or taboo subject matter relating to gender, race and history is inserted.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Gallagher began a series of large scale work including Paper Cup, which envelopes the viewer in a textured, apparently abstract surface which is actually a historic cosmology of repeated shapes \u2013 the rubbery lips, bow ties and rolling eyes of the vaudeville minstrels. In 1998 she developed a related series of black enamel paintings, inscribing the dark surface with calligraphic features relating to the minstrel stereotype.\n\nRecent developments have seen Gallagher collecting and appropriating images from magazines aimed at African American women, many of them suggesting the use of prosthetic enhancements to diminish blackness. In collaging a range of materials into the surfaces, including plasticine, rubber and coconut oil, Gallagher adds her own humorous prostheses, developing a personal visual language.\n\nGallagher\u2019s work expresses on the one hand how to be in the present, pushing forward the traditions and boundaries of painting; on the other, it reminds the viewer that however insignificant they may become, designations from the past continue to multiply and form part of the texture of the world today.\n\n\n ", "acquisition": "ARTIST ROOMS"},

His mother, who was of German and Swedish descent, was a chiropodist, and his father was cashier in a bank. As they both worked, his parents placed Weight with a foster mother, Rose Matkin, who was also his godmother and who lived in Fulham, then\na working class district. He spent his weeks with her and his weekends in his parents' more middle class household, acutely aware of the contrast between deprivation and affluence. From an early age he was sensitive to the unexpected - the shock of\nburning buildings or a bus mounting the pavement - and these events remained with him to infuse his paintings.Weight studied at the local Hammersmith School of Art (1928-30), where he met Ruskin Spear, who became a lifelong friend. With the\nencouragement of James Bateman, Weight moved to Goldsmiths' College (1931-3), where the teaching allowed scope for imaginative composition. This was Weight's preferred mode as was shown in important student works, such as Allegro Strepitoso,\n1932 (T05836), which performed a light hearted transformation of some of the art of the past. In 1934 he hired a space for an exhibition in the Cooling Galleries in Bond Street which attracted attention thanks to\na favourable mention in the Observer. Teaching at Beckenham School of Art (1932-9) enabled him to support himself. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists, and was a committee member of the Artists\nInternational Association, which helped artists fleeing Nazi Europe. After being called up to the Royal Engineers, he taught with the Army Education Corps (1944-5) before being sent to Italy as an official War Artist (1945-6). While encountering friends\nfrom Goldsmiths' and fellow War Artists like Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden, Weight had a free hand in choosing his topographical subjects. He also travelled to Vienna and to Greece, and would describe this formative experience as a 'scholarship\nfrom the army'. On his return to London in 1947, Weight was invited to teach at the Royal College of Art, where he participated in the revival of its fortunes. He executed a mural for the Country Pavilion of the Festival of Britain (1951). He\npainted landscapes and portraits, but much of his work captured a mood of melancholia, evident in the mysterious presences in his ghost paintings set in the unassuming urban settings of west and south London most familiar to the artist. He became\nProfessor of Painting at the Royal College of Art in 1957, and was awarded the CBE in 1962. In the following year he painted the mural Christ and the People for Manchester Cathedral, and in 1965 was elected RA, being celebrated with a one man\nexhibition at the Academy in 1982. After his retirement from the RCA in 1973, his work remained thematically complex while developing new techniques. He served in a number of honorary and official capacities including being President of the Stanley\nSpencer Society; he was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1995. He died in London on 13 August 1997, after a short illness.Bibliography:Carel Weight RA: A Retrospective Exhibition, exh. cat., Royal Academy, London 1982Mervyn Levy,\nRoyal Academy Painters and Sculptors: Carel Weight, London 1986'Artists' Lives', Interviews with Cathy Courtney, National Life Story Collection, British Library National Sound Archive, 1991-2, C466/07, Tapes F1898-1910,\nF2546-2554R.V.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n The painting was executed on the smooth side of a single piece of 3 mm hardboard panel. The board was prepared with a thin coat of what is probably an oil-based primer white primer, which may also have a layer of animal glue size beneath it. The paint was applied exclusively by brush in a fairly loose manner and mostly using a wet on dry technique, although there are some isolated areas of wet-in-wet evident. The paint is oil colour, possibly a mixture of artists' tube paints supplied by Rowney (for the earth colours) and Winsor and Newton (for the other colours), which are known to have been the artist's preferred choice of paints. An initial locating of the composition was made with a thin layer of light brown oil colour, which would have been excessively thinned with a diluent such as turpentine. This is still visible in many areas, for example along the left border of the table. Once the composition had been roughly established and this thinned paint had dried, the other colours were applied. The palette for the painting is polychrome, although clearly with a high content of mauve / purple. Most of the paint would have had a paste-like consistency and was probably used straight from the tube without any further thinning. Many areas consist of a single layer of paint, and there has been much use made of scraping back into the paint. In the brown area beneath the table, for example, the scraping back reveals the white ground layer beneath it. In other areas a number of layers have been built up to produce a heavily textured surface with quite high impasto. For example, the insides of the two fruit bowls have a white underlayer which holds all the texturing and the purple layer on top is in fact relatively thin.The painting was varnished with the painting in its frame, probably by the artist. Fedden is known to have varnished her works with a retouching varnish (usually based on ketone resins). The frame is original to the work, although the artist has expressed that she would not mind if it were coloured or replaced. The painting is in a very good condition. The hardboard is providing adequate support and the paint layers are not exhibiting any cracks or other forms of deterioration. The varnish layer is still transparent and has not yellowed appreciably. There is one slight damage to the hardboard support on the left edge which has been crudely restored so that the brushstrokes in the paint layers around the damage do not quite match up. The appearance of this repair was recently improved slightly with some additional inpainting. In addition, the framing of the work was modified to hold a supporting panel behind the hardboard, which should prevent the hardboard from developing a disturbing bow in its plane. At the same time glazing was added to the frame so that now it offers a far higher level of protection to the painting.Tom LearnerNovember 1997\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on hardboard", "date": "1968", "dimensions": "Support: 610 x 819 mm", "reference": "T07336", "title": "Mauve Still Life", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fedden-mauve-still-life-t07336", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07336_8.jpg", "artist": "Mary Fedden", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1915 \u2013 2012", "artistbio": "\n Mary Fedden was born in Bristol and wanted to be a painter even as a child.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Stephen Slaughter, the supposed painter of this small group portrait, or 'conversation piece', was an exact contemporary of William Hogarth (1697-1764). Indeed, the earliest recorded owner of this picture, Mathew Raper (1741-1826), vice President of the Society of Antiquaries and a Director of the Bank of England, was quite certain that it was by Hogarth. However, while his attribution has since proved to be incorrect, Raper did provide valuable information on the identity of the sitters.\n\nIn the centre of the picture, seated, holding her granddaughter, is Mrs Betts. To the left, dressed in orange and holding a floral riband, is her eldest-surviving daughter, Anne Betts. At the extreme right hand side, in a blue dress, is her youngest daughter, Rebecca, behind whom stands her husband, Edmund Anguish. It is their baby daughter, Anne (c.1745-1824), who sits in Mrs Betts's lap, and who in later life became the wife of the above mentioned Mathew Raper. It is also her approximate date of birth (she died in 1824, aged 79), that provides the suggested date of 1746 for the present picture. \n\nAt the extreme left of the picture, seated cross-legged, is Dr Benjamin Hoadly (1706-57), son of the Bishop of Winchester, royal physician and dramatist. In his hand Hoadly holds a miniature of his deceased first wife, Elizabeth Betts, sister of Anne and Rebecca, whom he had married in 1733. The date of Elizabeth Betts's death is unknown, although it must have been before June 1747, when Hoadly remarried. As Elizabeth Einberg has noted (Einberg 1983, p.416), the miniature held by Hoadly bears more than a passing resemblance to a bust-length portrait by Hogarth, thought to represent Elizabeth Hoadly (maiden name Betts), and which has been dated 1743. In any event, Hogarth was a good friend of the Hoadly family and painted their portraits on several occasions, the principal reason, it may be supposed, that the present picture was also attributed to him. Indeed, it has been suggested (Einberg and Egerton 1988, p.208) that the image of Dr Hoadly in the present portrait was not painted directly from life but from a head-and-shoulders portrait of him by Hogarth (Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales).\n\nIn the nineteenth century the picture passed from Mathew Raper, who had no children of his own, to his nephew, who died in 1849 at his home in Hyde Park. It then passed to Mrs Anne Sealy, who bequeathed it to the National Gallery in 1879 as 'The Hoadly Family in Hyde Park' by Hogarth. It was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1919, where it was described simply as 'British School'. Elizabeth Einberg disclosed the real identity of the sitters and provided the present attribution to Stephen Slaughter in 1983. \n\nAlthough the attribution to Stephen Slaughter is by no means definite, his known portraits, as Einberg remarks, 'exhibit the same dry linear style, fussiness over small features \u2026 a somewhat na\u00efve sense of perspective, combined with meticulous attention to detail' (Einberg 1983, p.416).\n\nFurther reading:Elizabeth Einberg, 'The Betts Family: A lost Hogarth that never was', The Burlington Magazine, vol.125, 1983, pp.415-16, fig.30Elizabeth Einberg and Judy Egerton, The Age of Hogarth.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nYou Can\u2019t Please All is a large, square oil painting on canvas by the Indian-born painter Bhupen Khakhar. To the right of the painting an almost life-size figure of a naked man leans over a balcony and surveys a townscape below him, which occupies the majority of the composition. The scene is sparsely populated and painted in cool blues, greys and greens which, along with the dark sky in the top left corner and the lights in the windows of the buildings, evoke twilight. Two figures and a donkey can be seen together in three seemingly separate instances, which appear to represent the same characters at different moments in time, implied by the difference in scale between each depiction. Elsewhere a man tends to his car and figures congregate inside homes. The balcony wall on which the naked man leans has a large section cut out of it, which, along with the visible interiors of the houses and the car door flung wide, gives the scene a sense of openness, heightened by the aerial perspective afforded by the view from the balcony. In contrast to the scene below, the building occupied by the naked man is painted in warmer reds and pinks, which serves to magnify the distinction between the private realm of the man\u2019s abode and the public world outside.\n\nYou Can\u2019t Please All was painted in 1981 in Baroda, in Gujarat, India, and took five months to complete. Khakhar only ever worked on one canvas at a time and painted slowly. Beginning by sketching the composition on the canvas in charcoal, Khakhar would then paint using small- or medium-sized brushes with the canvas laid flat on the floor. Khakhar believed that \u2018It is ultimately the colour which determines the painting\u2019 and he went to painstaking lengths to achieve the colours he wanted. The final touches would often involve applying pigment straight from the tube, contributing to the extreme thickness of the paint in some areas of his canvases.\nThe title of this work comes from one of Aesop\u2019s fables in which a father and son take their donkey to market. As the pair set out on their journey, someone they pass queries why neither of them is riding the donkey, so the older man puts his son on the donkey, only to be asked by another passer-by why the younger boy rides while his old father walks. As a result the man gets onto the donkey with his son only to be jeered at again for overloading the animal. The father and son then both get off the donkey and devise a plan to carry it by tying it to a long pole. The town crowd laughs at them as they cross a bridge and, as the donkey wriggles and writhes, the boy drops his end of the pole and the donkey falls into water below and drowns. An old man who followed them on their journey concludes the story by remarking: \u2018Please all, and you will please none!\u2019 In Khakar\u2019s painting different episodes from the fable can be identified, presenting a continuous narrative that weaves through the townscape. This pictorial device recalls the way stories were depicted in early Renaissance paintings, which Khakhar greatly admired.\nKhakhar trained as an accountant before studying painting in Baroda. His paintings draw upon different visual traditions, incorporating the colours and detailing of Indian miniatures and the boldness of Western pop art. During the 1970s Khakhar regularly painted tradesmen at work, but in the 1980s he began to engage with proverbs, and the narrative dimension of his work took on greater importance. A short while after making this painting Khakhar revealed that the naked male figure was himself and that this piece represented his coming-out as a homosexual (see Hyman 1998, p.69). The personal difficulties he faced at the time are suggested by the work\u2019s title, which implies that people he encountered did not accept his sexuality.\nThe British painter Dexter Dalwood, who lived in Baroda between 1985 ad 1986 and knew Khakhar, has written of You Can\u2019t Please All: \n\nThe naked figure on the balcony is internally separate from the society depicted, and yet at the same time, absolutely a part of the complex life which makes up the contradiction that is modern India. This way of combining complex emotional feelings, within an image which attempts to present a whole nervous-system, I find to be incredibly inspiring \u2013 and liberating.\n(Hyman 1998, p.67)\n\n\nYou Can\u2019t Please All was first exhibited as part of a group show titled Place for People, which toured from Bombay to New Delhi in 1981. The exhibition is now considered a turning point in Indian art as it marked a move away from symbolic and abstract imagery towards contemporary and personal subjects. It is also considered the beginning of the Baroda School, a loose grouping of figurative painters that includes Gulam Sheikh and Sudhir Patwardhan.\n\nFurther reading\nMahendra Desai, A Man Labelled Bhupen Khakhar Branded as Painter, Baroda 1983.\nBhupen Khakhar, exhibition catalogue, Centre Pompidou, Paris 1986, reproduced p.20.Timothy Hyman, Bhupen Khakhar, Bombay 1998, pp.66\u20139, reproduced pp.82\u20133.\nRebecca HealdMay 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1981", "dimensions": "Support: 1756 x 1756 mm", "reference": "T07200", "title": "You Can\u2019t Please All", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/khakhar-you-cant-please-all-t07200", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07200_8.jpg", "artist": "Bhupen Khakhar", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1934\u20132003", "artistbio": "\n Indian painter. His first exhibited works presented deities cut from popular prints, glued on to mirrors, supplemented by graffiti and gestural marks. He achieved international recognition in 1967 and was proclaimed as India's first Pop artist. Over the next few years he plundered other Indian genres \u2013 miniatures, Company paintings, temple maps.\nSeveral of the pictures of the early 1970s resemble shop signs for tailors, barbers, watch repairers, with vividly and crisply realised props. Implicit in paintings is a humorous acceptance and celebration of a culture previously disregarded, a hybrid, half-westernised culture of lower-middle class urban Indians, for whom Khakhar could act as spokesman. \nIn You Can't Please All (1981; London, Knoedler's) a life-size naked figure, a self-portrait, watches from a balcony, as father, son and donkey enact an ancient fable, winding through the townscape in continuous narration. The picture was conceived as a declaration; henceforth the artist spoke as a homosexual (another unregarded constituency in Indian culture).\nKhakhar's sexual explicitness has gone hand in hand with a deepening sense of the religious, and a convincing monumentality, often achieved through powerfully flattened colour. In Yayati (1987; priv. col.) the myth of the old king who asks his son to give him his youth is transformed into an extraordinary sexual statement. Khakhar's unwavering commitment to subject-matter in preference to stylistic concerns or avant-garde strategies has been important to younger artists. He is the central figure of the Baroda School, the loose grouping of figurative painters that includes Gulam Sheikh and Sudhir Patwardhan.\nBibliographyT.

La Thangue was noted for his strong convictions and forceful personality. In 1886, having completed his studies in Paris, he was the instigator of an abortive movement to reform the Royal Academy. Though he did not attend the meetings held by his contemporaries which led to the foundation of the New English Art Club (NEAC), La Thangue was arguably its most controversial exhibitor. \nLa Thangue lived for a time in Norfolk, painting scenes of Fenland life in a characteristic square-brush manner. He continued to produce large social realist pictures which courted controversy. \nIn the following years La Thangue's work showed a growing interest in French Impressionism. He travelled to Provence and Liguria, and scenes from these travels gradually infiltrated his work as he increasingly regretted the decline of village life in England. Just before the outbreak of World War I he staged a one-man exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, where he showed a wide selection of landscapes from southern Europe. The exhibition was a critical success and was lavishly praised in The New Age (7 May 1914) by Walter Sickert, who found La Thangue's use of the language of painting original. After the war, La Thangue returned to Liguria, and during the 1920s his entire production was given over to scenes of orange groves and gardens. He died in a state of depression at the news that some of his paintings had been destroyed in a shipwreck off the coast of New Zealand.\nBibliographyJ. S. Little: \u2018H. H. La Thangue', A. J.

A.) exemplifies his bold, blue-toned watercolour style, with washes applied in loose blotches to emphasize the picturesque roughness of masonry and terrain. He visited many parts of Britain and Ireland in search of subjects, such as Powys Castle, Montgomeryshire (U. Manchester, Whitworth A.G.). He exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1767, was made a Fellow in 1771 and Vice-President in 1778. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, from 1788 to 1807 but never sought membership.\nBy the late 1780s he was in semi-retirement, preferring to make scientific instruments. However, a financial downturn may have prompted his production of six etched Views in Italy (1795; set of proof impressions in London, BM). He is also thought to have designed the seals for the original 13 United States of America. His achievement as a topographical painter lies in his technical versatility, which allowed him to encompass both the tranquil compositions and cool lighting of British scenes and the picturesque roughness and more intense light of Italian views.\nBibliographyWilliam Marlow (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 2 is related to the view from 16 Hammersmith Terrace, the house beside the Thames in London where Pasmore lived from 1942-7. It is considered to be the third in a series of four paintings taking this view as their subject matter: The Gardens of Hammersmith 1944 (private collection), The Hanging Gardens of Hammersmith No.1 1944-7 (private collection), The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 2 1949, and The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 3 1947-9 (private collection). Initially Pasmore considered The Hanging Gardens of Hammersmith No.1 and The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 2 as a discrete pair separate from a wider series. However, the retrospective numbering of the paintings suggests that he revised his opinion and decided to tie all four works into a series demonstrating a gradual progression towards abstraction.\n\nThe compositional relationship between The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 2 and The Hanging Gardens of Hammersmith No.1 is like that of a reflected image in as much as the arrangement of the gardens and river is more or less reversed. Indeed, the view depicted in The Gardens of Hammersmith No.2 did not exist in nature. In the context of 1949, a year after Pasmore's first abstract works and two years after he had left Hammersmith, this open reference to a previous painting suggests a hermetic practice removed from the plein air legacy of Impressionism. Though attuned to the Impressionists' attempt to create objective painting, he commented in a letter to Kenneth Clark in 1948 that he 'would like to produce impressionist pictures painted, like the Old Masters, in the studio.' \n\nThe painting is subdivided by diagonal lines drawn in charcoal or pencil and picked out in places with red paint. Several of these lines meet at a point one quarter of the way up the righthand edge, others half way up the lefthand side. The lines represent the division of the gardens and serve as compositional aids. The river border of the gardens is marked by a line running from a quarter of the way up the lefthand side to the middle of the righthand edge. The trees are also arranged geometrically. The trunk of the tree on the far left marks a line bisecting the centre of the top edge. The next tree denotes the golden section of the width of the painting, the third is exactly mid-way.\n\nThis precise composition is inscribed in pencil or charcoal on a painted white ground. The bushes have been drawn in charcoal, or possibly cont\u00e9 crayon, and rubbed into the ground to achieve the smudged effect visible through the coloured dots. The trees are rendered in tones of red-brown. In contrast to these pointillist and linear forms, the sky is painted with smooth modulations of white, pale blue and pink.\n\nDuring the war, Pasmore had studied many of the Post-Impressionists' writings, and in the following years he worked through some of their ideas in his own paintings. The impact of Seurat's Pointillism is particularly evident here. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nAlan Bowness and Luigi Lambertini, Victor Pasmore, with a Catalogue Raison\u00e9e of the Paintings, Constructions and Graphics 1926-1979, London 1980, reproduced p.79, cat.127Bruce Laughton, The Euston Road School: A Study in Objective Painting, Aldershot 1986, reproduced p.293Norbert Lynton, Victor Pasmore: Nature into Art, exhibition catalogue, Center for International Contemporary Arts, New York 1990, reproduced p.16, fig.3\n\nToby TrevesMay 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1949", "dimensions": "Support: 765 x 969 mm", "reference": "T07033", "title": "The Gardens of Hammersmith No. 2", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/pasmore-the-gardens-of-hammersmith-no-2-t07033", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07033_8.jpg", "artist": "Victor Pasmore", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1908\u20131998", "artistbio": "\n Victor PASMORE b. 1908\n\nAbstract artist, producing paintings, collages and constructions; previously a representational painter of landscapes, still life and figures.

By the early 1950s Minton's reputation was in decline. His commitment to figure composition seemed out-dated in the face of American Abstract Expressionism.

A celebrity of London's bohemia and a key figure of Neo-Romanticism in the 1940s, he lived and worked with most of the younger generation Neo-Romantics. Invalided out of the army in 1943, he devoted himself to art, producing work for seven one-man shows between 1945 and 1956.\nMinton's eclectic style combined elements of French and British Neo-Romanticism. His main theme, partly homoerotic, was the young male figure in emotionally charged settings. Five phases in his work have been identified, ranging from landscapes reminiscent of those of Samuel Palmer, to scenes of urban decay, such as Rotherhithe from Wapping (1946; Southampton, C.A.G.). In the post-war years he was attracted to exotic places in search of new subjects.\nAlthough Minton was dedicated to painting, his reputation depended largely on his skill as an illustrator, for example the Corsican illustrations for Time Was Away by Alan Ross (London, 1948). He taught at Camberwell School of Art (1943\u20136), Central School of Art and Crafts (1946\u20138) and at the Royal College of Art until 1957, devoting the last part of his life to theatre design. A product of his age, Minton was charismatic, charming and generous but also melancholic and self-destructive. His illustrative style had become the fashionable norm of the period, but as a figurative painter the arrival of abstraction increased feelings of self-doubt, compounding personal problems, which led to his suicide.BibliographyJohn Minton, 1917\u20131957: Paintings, Drawings, Illustrations and Stage Designs (exh. cat., intro.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The painting shows the artist's wife Alice with their infant son John in the first-floor sitting room of their house at 26 Church Row, Hampstead. Rothenstein married Alice Knewstub (the actress Alice Kingsley) in 1899. The couple first lived at Edwardes Square, Kensington before moving to the larger house at Hampstead in November 1902. The baby Alice was then expecting died immediately after birth, in December. John, their first child, had been born on 11 July 1901, and was therefore about age two at the time of this portrait. Their second surviving child, Rachel, born in December 1903, was probably expected at the time this painting was made.\n\nRothenstein's depiction of detail was accurate, and the Queen Anne interior of the house remains virtually unchanged today, apart from a built-in bookcase. Two paintings are displayed in the interior: the oil sketch on the mantelpiece is probably a copy by Rothenstein of a detail of an unknown old master painting; the small framed pastel on the wall is another portrait by Rothenstein himself of his wife and son (Mother and Child, City Art Gallery, Manchester, exhibited New English Art Club, 1902). Alterations made to the painting by the artist are faintly visible. There was once a stool or similar object at the left of the fender; the curtains at right were added later; and part of the carpet area was once red, although this may have been for a different picture.\n\nRothenstein was well known at beginning of the century as a landscape and portrait painter. A double portrait of his wife and her sister, The Browning Readers (1900, Bradford City Art Gallery), was the first of several portraits in which the interior is as important as the figure. All depict his own family or close friends, and show his own rooms. He later described the group of pictures as if a series: 'For some time now I was occupied with 'interiors'; my wife figures in many of these ... and, like most artists with their first child, I made countless studies of babes, and of mother and babe' (Rothenstein, II, p.26). He first painted his wife and son in 1901 (Mother and Child, private collection), and subsequently made various pastels and paintings of the mother and child theme until at least 1909. In several of these paintings Alice wears the same (or very similar) black skirt and jacket as in the Tate's Mother and Child. Rothenstein's detailed interest in the subject of figures in interiors is suggested by the following listing in his record book of his pictures (copy in Tate Gallery catalogue file): 'Interior of drawing room. Alice at window, Gainsborough drawings on wall, open piano. Commenced November 1900, finished April 1901'. The five months he spent on this painting was a considerable amount of time for such a subject. The painting mentioned was bought for \u00a370, less 10%, by Professor Fred Brown of the Slade School of Art, and is now in a private collection.\n\nIt is likely that Rothenstein made a study in pastels for this portrait, since this was then his usual practice. There are two etchings of Alice holding a slightly younger John in a similar pose (exhibited William Rothenstein, Max Rutherston Gallery, London 1990, nos.74-5). Possibly these were not intended as direct studies for the painting, but may nevertheless be the origin of the pose in profile.\n\nContemporary critics, referring to this picture, made mention of its composition, colour, handling and detail. Several critics compared the painting to Dutch seventeenth-century interiors, mentioning Vermeer and De Hoogh. Interest in Dutch painting became a fashion at the New English Art Club, of which Rothenstein was a member. \n\nThe carved and gilt frame, dating to about 1700, would probably not have been affordable by the artist in 1903, and was most likely acquired for the painting by Edgar Hesslein, Rothenstein's brother-in-law, who bought the painting from Rothenstein for \u00a3175 in 1903.\n\nJohn Rothenstein grew up to be an art historian and was Director of the Tate Gallery from 1938 to 1964. Knighted in 1952, he died on 27 February 1992. He is also represented in two other portraits by his father in the Tate Gallery, The Princess Badroulbadour, 1908 (Tate Gallery N03953), depicting him as a child with his two younger sisters, and a 1938 oil, Portrait of Sir John Rothenstein C.B.E. (Tate Gallery T01869).\n\nFurther reading:\nWilliam Rothenstein, Men and Memories, II, London 1932, pp.26, 28, 32 \nRobert Speaight, William Rothenstein: The Portrait of an Artist in his Time, London 1962, p.157\n\nTerry Riggs\nJanuary 1998\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1903", "dimensions": "Support: 969 x 765 mm", "reference": "T05075", "title": "Mother and Child", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rothenstein-mother-and-child-t05075", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05075_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir William Rothenstein", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1872\u20131945", "artistbio": "\n title=\"Glossary definition for 'Print'\" onmousemove=\"setLayer(this,'glossaryPopupLayer');\" onclick=\"return getDefinition(233);\"&gt;printmaker, teacher and writer. He was the son of a wool merchant and delighted in the grim landscape of his native Yorkshire, which was the subject of some early watercolours. His talent was recognized as early as 1891, when an exhibition of his work and that of Charles Conder at the Galerie Hadrien Thomas in Paris attracted the attention of many artists including Pissarro and Degas. After an inspiring four years he left Paris for Oxford where he made a number of portrait lithographs.\nRothenstein was also prolific as a painter. In the early 1900s his style gradually evolved towards brighter colours in response to Post-Impressionism, but he never incorporated its more advanced developments into his own art. He had a particular feeling for the landscapes of Gloucestershire, where he lived from 1912 to 1919.\nDuring World War I Rothenstein was an Official War Artist to the British and Canadian armies on the Western Front, recording the devastation caused by war. Between 1920 and 1935 he served as Principal of the Royal College of Art, where his pupils included Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Serious illness prevented him from drawing or painting in the mid 1920s. He had the pleasure of working as an artist almost to the end of his life. His son Michael Rothenstein (1908\u201393) was also an artist.\nBibliographyH. W. [H. Wellington]: William Rothenstein (London, 1923)J.

Certainly it is completely unlike the illustrations of 1911\u201312 in Rhythm in 1911 &amp; 12, and those of 1920 (Group X) and afterwards. However, perhaps because of the different media, it appears more space-conscious, more abstract and less decorative than the woodcuts in Blast. More precisely it seems to reflect the style of Bomberg's \u2018Mud Bath\u2019 (1913\u201314) rather than that of Wyndham Lewis.\n\nAlthough it is not yet possible to date the picture any more accurately than this, two scraps of evidence bear on the evolution of her abstract style. The three portrait studies she exhibited at the A.A.A. exhibition at the Albert Hall in 1913 are annotated in the Tate Gallery copy of the catalogue as \u2018cubist\u2019 (Lewis' works are described as \u2018silly\u2019 and Brancusi's \u2018Muse Endormie\u2019 as \u2018quaint\u2019).\n\nIn 1914 she acquired a copy of Sadler's translation of Kandinsky's \u2018\u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst\u2019. (Information from Mr Ody, Excerpts from the same work were translated in Blast I 1914 by Wadsworth.

By spring 1914 she had become an enthusiastic member of the Rebel Art Centre, and her name appeared on the list of signatures at the end of the Vorticist manifesto in the first issue of Blast magazine (1914).\nLittle survives of Dismorr's Vorticist work, but her illustrations in Blast show that she shared the Vorticist's involvement with the dynamism of the machine-age city. Abstract Composition (1914\u201315; London, Tate) employs sturdy, girder-like forms to animate a vision that she described in the poem Monologue, published in the second issue of Blast (1915). Here she admired \u2018the new machinery that wields the chain of muscles fitted beneath/my close coat of skin', outlining the amalgam of human and mechanical imagery that lay at the centre of Vorticism.\nAfter participating in the Vorticist Exhibition of June 1915, Dismorr did voluntary war work in France. She was included in the Vorticist Exhibition of January 1917, held in New York and in 1926 became a member of the London Group and the Seven and Five Society.

After his house was bombed in 1940 he moved to a patch of woodland near Petworth, W. Sussex, living at first in a caravan which later acquired numerous outbuildings. He worked there for the next 40 years, distanced from the predominantly literary currents of British modern art. In his commitment to colour and open brushwork he was closer to the modern French masters, especially in his Fauvist orange nudes set in sunlit interiors. He painted mostly outdoors, however, and his technique developed from a tonal treatment that recalled the informality of Constable's sketches.\nHitchens neither painted landscape as a detached observer, nor did he abstract forms from nature, and he valued the disciplines of C\u00e9zanne too highly to allow structure to be controlled by subjective response alone.

In 1903 he helped found the Burlington Magazine. \nFry's life and career underwent abrupt changes in 1910. He opened the exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists at the Grafton Galleries. This, with the Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition effectively brought the British public up to date with developments in art that had taken place in France over the previous 30 years, and radically altered Fry's reputation. He was regarded in England as the apostle of modern art. He was involved with various artists' groups and was the prime mover behind the Omega Workshops, which flourished between 1913 and 1919.\nWith the appearance in 1920 of Vision and Design, a collection of articles and essays, Fry's influence as a critic and arbiter of taste was further extended.\nHis work as critic and exhibition organiser was for some time regarded as an innovative and advantageous influence upon modern art in Britain. However, opinion subsequently viewed his legacy as restrictive and unsupportive of British traditions. Ironically, this man who did much to expand the audience for art came to be criticised for his exclusiveness, for insisting on a formalist approach at the expense of historical and sociological enquiry.\nBibliographyD.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nIn this work by American artist Jenny Holzer, an image of a military map of Iraq has been screen-printed onto a linen canvas covered in a thin, translucent layer of violet oil paint. The map was first photocopied onto clear film, called a photo-stencil, which was used in the screen-printing process to transfer the image onto the canvas. The map features various labels, arrows and symbols. Three signs for military jets point towards the capital city of Baghdad, which lies almost at the centre of the screen print. Three labels reading \u2018Protect\u2019 frame the north, west and south sides of the map (where Iraq borders Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia respectively). Around the map are various instructional labels, with the words \u2018Suppress\u2019, \u2018Fix\u2019, \u2018Seize\u2019, \u2018Isolate\u2019, \u2018Shock and Awe\u2019, \u2018Exploit\u2019 and \u2018Gain Control\u2019. (\u2018Shock and awe\u2019 was a phrase used by the American government to describe its tactic of using overwhelming power during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.) These instructions suggest the defensive and offensive strategies of a military force. A box in the top right-hand corner notes details of the image\u2019s declassification in June 2006.\nThis large-scale canvas is part of Holzer\u2019s Redaction Paintings series, which the artist began in 2006. It is one of six works from this series in the ARTIST ROOMS collection. Material for this series came from declassified US government documents, particularly those concerning national security, economic policy and foreign relations. Holzer began to use US government files in her work in 2004, taking advantage of the US 1966 Freedom of Information Act, which allows any requesting member of the public to view declassified documents. Redaction refers to the censoring of information in a text, and as the title of the series of Redaction Paintings suggests, Holzer\u2019s images were based on documents redacted by the US government before being made publicly available. Many of the source documents used in the series were made almost entirely illegible through the work of censors before their release, but this appears not to have been the case with the source image used for Protect Protect, which has only two lines of text crossed out. Holzer\u2019s use of a photo-stencil to screen-print the image of the map allowed every element of the document to be reproduced in all its original detail.\n\nProtect Protect makes no explicit critique of its subject matter, but by taking this map out of its military context and holding it up to public scrutiny in an art gallery, Holzer probes the boundaries between transparency and censorship, inviting viewers to reflect upon documentary evidence that offers an alternative reality to the images of war presented in the mass media, while avoiding sensationalist images or the direct representation of violence. The artist has explained her motivation to make such work: \u2018As one becomes habituated to things, their intensity is dulled \u2026 in the last decades of the twentieth century, political rhetoric on all sides became so strident and inflated that obliqueness and artful understatement proved the most effective means of catching the attention of a weary public.\u2019 (Storr 2006, p.14.)\nDescribed by the art critic Robert Storr as \u2018a verbal maze of specialised terminology, acronyms, abbreviations, rote salutations and initials\u2019 (Storr 2006, p.8), the Redaction Paintings were the first works on canvas Holzer exhibited in her career. Before this, she was known primarily for her language-based works, involving a variety of media including posters, LED screen works and projections.\n\nFurther reading\nRobert Storr, Jenny Holzer: Redaction Paintings, New York 2006.Cathy Lebowitz, \u2018Protect Us From What We Don\u2019t Know\u2019, Art in America, vol.94, no.9, October 2006, pp.162\u20136.\nJenny Holzer: Protect Protect, exhibition catalogue, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago 2010.\nFlorence RitterJanuary 2012\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "2007", "dimensions": "Support: 2011 x 2600 x 40 mm", "reference": "AR00083", "title": "Protect Protect", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/holzer-protect-protect-ar00083", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/AR/AR00083_8.jpg", "artist": "Jenny Holzer", "collection": "\n        Tate / ", "artistlife": " born 1950", "artistbio": "\n American installation and conceptual artist.

In 1974 she took summer courses at the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, entering its MFA programme in 1975 and beginning her first work with language, installation and public art. Holzer moved to New York in 1977. Her first public works, Truisms (1977\u20139), appeared in the form of anonymous broadsheets pasted on buildings, walls and fences in and around Manhattan. Commercially printed in cool, bold italics, numerous one-line statements such as \u2018Abuse of power comes as no surprise' and \u2018There is a fine line between information and propaganda', were meant to be provocative and elicit public debate. Thereafter Holzer used language and the mechanics of late 20th-century communications as an assault on established notions of where art should be shown, with what intention and for whom. Her texts took the forms of posters, monumental and electronic signs, billboards, television and her signature medium, the LED (light emitting diode) sign. Other works appeared on T-shirts, tractor hats, stickers, metal plaques, park benches and sarcophagi. The LED signs have been placed in high-impact public spaces such as Times Square, New York, as well as in art galleries and museums.\nBibliographyJenny Holzer: Signs (exh. cat., Des Moines, IA, A.

Although he had reacted against the domination of Abstract Expressionism, he had no intention of reintroducing realism. His work is often associated with Conceptual art, but although organized into non-representational systems, it is fundamentally a quest for pictorial expression.\nRyman reduced his painting to the strict minimum: the square format and the colour white. He permutated and varied these constants by manipulating scale and texture. Small and large formats were arranged on the same wall and all sorts of media were applied to a variety of supports so that the results were always different. Ryman demonstrated that pictorial complexity can be achieved by using an extremely restricted vocabulary. He sought to heighten the viewer's sensitivity to subtle variations in the brushwork, surfaces and materials employed as well as the relation of the painted areas to the edges of the support. He also insisted on the relation of the painting to the wall on which it hangs, either by attaching it very closely, even to the point of painting the wall itself, or by detaching it in a visually obvious way. From 1976 he incorporated the hanging system into the composition of the picture, using metal fastenings whose function is both visual and practical. Close to Minimal art, Ryman's work may be distinguished from it by the importance he gave to the painted surface and to the painter's touch, using these as essential elements in his highly refined examination of the optical and material properties of the painting discipline.\nBibliographyArt in Progress IV (exh. cat. by R.

He studied at Glasgow School of Art (1975\u20137 and 1979\u201381) and was one of the central figures in the school of Scottish figurative painting that rose to prominence in the 1980s. His large-format paintings typically show massive, predominantly male figures, drawn with muscular brushstrokes, illustrating a harsh and unredemptive view of the modern world. This bleak view was developed in several subsequent series, Howson's work as the official British War Artist in Bosnia, involving visits there in 1993, provided him with a highly charged subject-matter that gave new ethical direction and motivation to his work. Among the paintings derived from this experience was Croatian and Muslim (oil on canvas, 2.13\u00d71.53 m, 1994; D. Bowie priv. col., see Jackson, p. 72), showing two men raping a woman while pushing her head into a lavatory. This and other images of sexual violence and brutality aroused strong controversy concerning the role of the war artist. In 1998 he made a portfolio of 50 etchings, Undergound (see 1998 exh. cat., p. 5), that demonstrated his continuing interest in allegorical portraiture and the translation of his concerns to the South of England after he settled in London in 1994. He was awarded the Henry Moore Foundation Prize in 1988, the Lord Provost's Medal, Glasgow, in 1995, and the following year was made Doctor of Letters, Honoras Causa, by the University of Strathclyde.\nBibliographyPeter Howson (exh. cat., essay D.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nUntitled #5 is a large abstract painting on canvas by the Canadian\u2013American artist Agnes Martin, signed and inscribed by the artist on its verso. The square pictorial field is divided into eleven horizontal bands of white, blue and peach acrylic paint. The colours alternate in a regular pattern and the divisions are demarcated by wavering graphite pencil lines. As with all works from this period by Martin, Untitled #5 was begun by priming the entire surface of the canvas with an opaque coating of white acrylic gesso, which is never fully covered by subsequent layers of colour. This gives the painting a visual sparseness and vibrant luminosity; the thick white gesso sealing and emphasising the slightly toothy texture of the linen canvas support. On top of this base coat of paint the artist measured out and marked with pencil rectangular bands across the width of the canvas, into which she painted alternating duck-egg blue and pale peach \u2018salmon-brick\u2019 colours using a different type of acrylic, Liquitex, which gives a translucent and tempera-like finish. These same colours appear in the later paintings Faraway Love 1999 (Tate AR00178) and Happy Holiday 1999 (Tate AR00179), but in Untitled #5 they are applied with lighter, looser brush strokes and the Liquitex was diluted to produce almost gestural veils of colour. Within the composition\u2019s repeating horizontals, the three bands left empty of colour are also the widest, at approximately one and a half times the width of the peach and blue bands. This irregularity reinforces the white gesso\u2019s role as a blank background onto which colours and pencil marks have been inscribed. The painting was completed by further reinforcement of the pencil lines demarcating the striped surface of the canvas. By drawing on top of the acrylic paints, Martin reverses the traditional notion of drawing as preparatory work to be painted over. These strong, persistent horizontal lines are the final addition to the work, and are drawn so as not to reach the edge of the canvas, creating the impression that they are floating across the colour field. Explaining her drawing technique, the artist stated in an interview with the critic Joan Simon that: \n\nI use a small ruler, 18 inches long, and draft-draw across the canvas \u2026 because using a big ruler to draw a line clear across the canvas is impossible. The canvas goes back just a little, and the line\u2019s not straight.\u2019 \n(Simon 1996, p.84.) \n\nThis shuddering, incremental approach to delineation emphasises the centrality of drawing to Martin\u2019s painting practice. The type of line produced by the artist is not rigidly straight; despite her use of a ruler it exhibits an undeniably hand-drawn quality. In its tracing of the bumps of the canvas surface, it echoes the looseness of the brush strokes of acrylic. As the art historian and curator Ned Rifkin has articulated of these works: \u2018Geometry is an abstract system of order concerned with the relation between shapes. It is also an ideal. It refers to a perfection of form that does not actually exist within the natural world. In contrast, the rectangles Martin describes within the square format of her canvases are irregular and imperfect.\u2019 (Rifkin 2002, pp.25\u20136.) \n\nUntitled #5 was first exhibited in 1995 at PaceWildenstein Gallery in New York. It is part of the first series of paintings the artist produced after moving from the remote area of Galisteo, New Mexico to a new studio and home in the town of Taos, where she remained until her death in 2004 at the age of ninety-two. This series of untitled paintings also introduced a new format into Martin\u2019s work: five\u2013foot square canvases, a reduction from her signature six\u2013foot square stretchers, which the artist could no longer handle easily. Within the artist\u2019s extremely spare and coherent painting vocabulary, Martin had employed the six\u2013foot format since 1960, as the basis of all\u2013over grid works such as Morning 1965 (Tate T01866). Ned Rifkin has remarked that \u2018this seemingly slight change has introduced a new intimacy of scale and simultaneously opened her work to a decidedly more lyrical tone in colour and feeling.\u2019 (Rifkin 2002, p.26.) \nIn contrast to other paintings by Martin in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, the series to which Untitled #5 belongs was left untitled and numbered sequentially. In subsequent years, the artist began using emotive and poetic phrases to title her works, such as Faraway Love and Happy Holiday, that are subtly evocative of her natural world\u2013inspired titles from the 1960s, such as Leaf, Milk River and White Flower. Indeed, while the 1990s work remains resolutely abstract, the fundamental qualities of her chosen surroundings certainly impact upon paintings such as Untitled #5. In her prose poem of 1973 entitled \u2018The Untroubled Mind\u2019, the artist wrote: \n\nI saw the plains driving out of New Mexico and I thought\nthe plain had it \njust the plane \nIf you draw a diagonal, that\u2019s loose at both ends\nI don\u2019t like circles \u2013 too expanding\nWhen I draw horizontals\nyou see this big plane and you have certain feelings like \nyou\u2019re expanding over the plane \nAnything can be painted without representation. \n(Quoted in Schwarz 1991, p.37.) \n\n\nFurther reading\nDieter Schwarz (ed.), Agnes Martin: Writings/Schriften, Ostfildern 1991.Joan Simon, \u2018Perfection is in the Mind: An Interview with Agnes Martin\u2019, Art in America, vol.84, no.5, May 1996, pp.82\u20139, 124.Ned Rifkin, Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond, exhibition catalogue, The Menil Collection, Houston 2002.\nStephanie StraineAugust 2010\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint and graphite on canvas", "date": "1994", "dimensions": "Support: 1525 x 1528 x 35 mm", "reference": "AR00177", "title": "Untitled #5", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-untitled-5-ar00177", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/AR/AR00177_8.jpg", "artist": "Agnes Martin", "collection": "\n        Tate / ", "artistlife": " 1912\u20132004", "artistbio": "\n Agnes Martin born 1912American abstract painter born in Maklin, Saskatchewan, Canada.\nMoved to the USA in 1932.

He was raised in a northern industrial environment that was to appear with great forcefulness in his Vorticist work. Like many other Vorticists, Wadsworth's interest in the machine showed itself at an early age. Under the impact of the Post-Impressionists, he turned for a while to portraiture, beach scenes and still-lifes.\nWadsworth was equally interested in the new vision of the world opened up by air travel. Since so many of his paintings of the Vorticist period have been lost, woodcuts provide a valuable insight into his approach; in his extended series he often looks down on northern industrial centres from far above. This dizzying new perspective enabled him to organise his forms in a remarkably abstract way, even though he retained reference to factory chimneys, railway lines and striped fields.\nWadsworth served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve until invalided out in 1917. Wadsworth's vast painting of Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool (3\u00d72.4 m; 1919; Ottawa, N.G.) heralded his return to a more representational way of seeing.\nMaritime themes were his principal subjects in the following period. They led him, at first, in the direction of a more straightforward naturalism. A strain of Surrealist unease and expectancy gradually entered Wadsworth's work. \nWadsworth travelled widely and contributed to the Parisian journal Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation. He also became a founder-member of Unit one, a group dedicated to promoting the spirit of renewal in British art between the wars.

Collins\nheld an exhibition in the Barn Studio (1937) attached to the Dartington Hall Art Department and, after Tobey's departure in 1938, he taught there (1939-43) alongside Bernard Leach, Hein Heckroth and Willi Soukop (q.v). The combination of interests in\nFar Eastern art and philosophy and German Expressionist performance proved important, and it was there that Collins began the series of Fools. Between 1944 and 1948, the Collinses divided their time between London and Cambridge. His exhibition at\nLefevre's (Feb. 1944) escaped major damage even though blown off the walls in an air raid, and two more exhibitions in London followed in 1945. This period saw the publication of the first monograph on the artist by Alex Comfort (Cecil Collins:\nPaintings and Drawings 1935-45, 1946) and Collins's own major text written in 1944, The Vision of the Fool (1947). Both confirmed the artist's links with the poets of the 'Apocalypse' group and the associated inclination towards a\nvisionary Neo-Romanticism in painting. In Cambridge from 1948, the Collinses were part of a circle, including the painters Nan Youngman and Elisabeth Vellacott, which founded the Cambridge Society of Painters and Sculptors (1955). From 1951, Collins\nalso taught life drawing part-time with Mervyn Peake at the Central School of Art in London. He had a major retrospective at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1959, which included some 'matrical' paintings, which developed mystical images from gestural\nbeginnings. The Collinses moved to Chelsea in 1970. He received a number of religious commissions, making an altar front for the Chapel of St Clement in Chichester Cathedral (1973), for which Elisabeth made kneelers, and windows for St Michael and All\nSaints, Basingstoke (1985). In 1979 he was awarded the MBE. A retrospective of his prints at the Tate Gallery in 1981, was followed by one of paintings and drawings in 1989. The painter died on 4 June 1989, during the course of this exhibition. \nFurther reading:Cecil Collins, The Vision of the Fool, London 1947, reprinted Chipping Norton 1981 Richard Morphet, The Prints of Cecil Collins, exh. cat., Tate Gallery 1981Judith Collins, Cecil\nCollins: A Retrospective Catalogue, exh. cat., Tate Gallery 1989Cecil Collins, The Vision of the Fool and Other Writings, ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The picture shows a lofty, barn-like room, its plain walls hung with framed prints and an\narray of pistols, guns and spears. Six members of the Norwich-based Carrow Abbey Hunt, named on the frame, are seen in relaxed mood, gloved and booted, ready to go. They await their huntsman, James Mead, who is shown entering at the left. From left to\nright the members of the hunt are: Timothy Tompson, son of a brewer; Robert Harvey, manufacturer, later banker and, in 1787, Mayor of Norwich; John Morse, brewer and Mayor of Norwich in 1781 and 1803; Jeremiah Ives, Mayor in 1786 and 1801; Jeremiah\nTompson; John South Morse. They hunted for deer, fox and hare around St Faith's and Spixworth to the north of Norwich and in Bixley, Arminghall, Poringland and Brooke district to the south. Reinagle's painting descended in the Morse family and was\npresumably commissioned by the John Morse depicted here as the central figure. Two other versions of this picture are known to exist. A smaller one is in the Bearsted collection; the other, painted a year later in 1781, is currently in a private\ncollection in New York. It is clearly related to this version, but set in a grander and more elegant panelled interior. Also painted for the Morse family, it has not only a similar frame identifying the sitters, but also an elaborate contemporary\ninscription on the back spelling out precisely how the picture was to be passed on from one member of the hunt to the next. Philip Reinagle's long career encompassed portrait, landscape, sporting and animal painting, and it is for the latter that\nhe is best known. As an artist, however, he is of particular interest for the fact that he was apprenticed to Allan Ramsay (1713-84) at fourteen, and remained his friend and assistant for life. Ramsay's stylishness and delicacy of touch is reflected in\nthis work.

During this time Reinagle is reported to have made more\nthan ninety copies for Ramsay of his coronation portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte. Thereafter Reinagle specialised in animal painting but also painted landscapes and portraits. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1773 to 1827, becoming an\nAssociate in 1787 and a full member in 1812. Italian subjects exhibited in 1799, 1800 and 1806 and a Portuguese one in 1816 suggest visits abroad. Reinagle also exhibited at the British Institution from 1806 to 1829. He died in London.

In 1967 he moved to Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynned, a slate-quarrying village, motivated by a desire to escape the \u2018unnecessarily competitive' metropolitan art world. As a student Nash became interested in the art and writing of China; other interests include the painting of Abstract Expressionist Arshile Gorky, as well as the theoretical implications of Minimalism, although he found much Minimalist work \u2018completely devoid of the human spirit'. Nash's early works were in part a response to both Minimalism and the sculpture in the New Generation 65 exhibition (1965; London, Whitechapel A.G.), which included work by Philip King and William Tucker. From the late 1960s he developed his holistic approach to art; his first exhibition Briefly Cooked Apples (1973; York Festival) revealed his belief that his activity was a collaboration with nature. The free-standing sculptures were accompanied by a leaflet reproducing his sketches, including some of ways of ordering wood in bundles, stacks or rows. Wood became Nash's primary material, being used in both temporary and permanent land-based works; for Black Dome (1986) 900 lengths of charred larch formed a low dome (c. 7 m diameter) that would eventually be reabsorbed into the soil in the Forest of Dean, England. Nash also had numerous artist residencies in sculpture parks in England.\nBibliographySixty Seasons (exh. cat., ed. M. Tooby and C.

He lived in the USA and Rome before studying at the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1928\u201331). Early acclaim in the 1930s resulted from his part in the formation of the Objective abstraction group. With the development of Social Realism in the late 1930s, Moynihan abandoned abstraction as increasingly isolating and from 1937 became closely associated with the Euston Road School.As Official War Artist (1943), ARA (1944) and Professor of Painting at the Royal College of Art, London (1948\u201357), Moynihan received important portrait commissions. In the mid 1950s Moynihan again painted abstract pictures such as Red Painting, February 1959 (priv. col., see 1978 exh. cat., p. 42). After working in a richly impastoed style with a lighter palette, c. 1961 he adopted smoother surfaces with broad areas of saturated colour punctuated by personal symbols or motifs. From 1964 to 1968 he was an editor for the journal Art and Literature.\nIn the early 1970s Moynihan returned to figuration, taking as his preferred subject his unordered studio shelves in works such as Oval Still-Life: Roll of Paper and Paintbox (1974\u20135; priv. col., see 1978 exh. cat., p. 52). His tools and materials are precisely depicted in austere and sombre tones, viewed obliquely throwing the horizontal plane into deep perspective. He also turned again to portraits of friends, to self-portraits, and to commissioned portraits such as that of Margaret Thatcher (1983; London, N.P.G.). From 1957 Moynihan lived and worked in France, Spain, the USA and Britain.\nBibliographyRodrigo Moynihan: Still-life Paintings (exh. cat., intro. R.

He made a sketch in the theatre, but it is represented only schematically in this painting, and the detail is not important. In the right hand half of the painting; shown upside down, is the shape of the stepped hemispherical seats and the row of columns behind them. The drawing of the other half of the painting is taken from the large hanging plants and the metal window of his studio. The geometry of these is distorted, and they are shown as they would appear in a concave mirror. In both halves the design was made from a recollection of the subjects, and not copied from them. The artist said in conversation (2 February 1983) that he thought of these two shapes on either side of the canvas as if each was a projection of the other in coordinate geometry.\n\nThe reds and the oranges in the painting are fluorescent paint, which Hayter has used in his work for more than twenty years. The purpose is to increase the depth and ambiguities of the space, as well as to reveal the colours beneath, since the paint is translucent. This configuration of space, with a central perspective with orthogonals converging from either side, Hayter had used in prints slightly earlier, such as the large colour etching \u2018Serre\u2019 (1979).\n\nThis entry has been approved by the artist.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1982-84: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1986\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1980", "dimensions": "Support: 1137 x 1458 mm", "reference": "T03407", "title": "Teatro Olimpico", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hayter-teatro-olimpico-t03407", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03407_8.jpg", "artist": "Stanley William Hayter", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1901\u20131988", "artistbio": "\n English printmaker, draughtsman and painter, active in France and the USA. In 1926 he settled in Paris, where he enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and studied burin engraving. In 1929 Hayter was introduced to Surrealism by Yves Tanguy and Andr\u00e9 Masson. The often violent imagery of Hayter's Surrealist period was stimulated in part by his passionate response to the Spanish Civil War and to the rise of Fascism. \nHayter joined the exile of the Parisian avant-garde in 1939, moving to New York. He ran a course entitled \u2018Atelier 17'. His theoretical writings on automatism and the expressive abstraction of his own work were a formative influence on Pollock and others. Hayter's first book, New Ways of Gravure (1949), became an indispensable text for printmakers.\nIn the 1930s Hayter had concentrated his technical experimentation on adapting the traditional black-and-white techniques of etching and engraving to the aesthetic concerns of modern art. From the 1940s his primary technical preoccupation was with colour printing. In the 1950s, when he reopened the workshop in Paris, Hayter explored an entirely different method of colour etching, in which inks of contrasting viscosities were applied with rollers to a plate etched to different levels. This technique suited the increasingly Tachist look of his prints, in which he explored chance effects and his fascination with waves. From the 1970s Hayter reintroduced figurative elements in combination with a vibrant palette and lyrical freedom of brushstroke or burin line in some of his most fluent and imaginative works.\nBibliography\u2018Hayter and Studio 17', MOMA Bull., xii/1 (Aug 1944) [issue dedicated to Hayter]G.

He wrote poetry during the early 1940s.\nFrom 1953 to 1956 Davie taught in London at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he became interested in African and Pacific art.\nAs early as 1958 Davie emphasised the importance in his work of intuition, as expressed in the form of enigmatic signs. During the 1960s, both in paintings and in coloured lithographs, he represented such images with increasing clarity at the expense of gestural handling. In 1971 he made his first visit to the island of St Lucia, where he began to spend half of each year and which brought Caribbean influences to bear on his suggestive imagery, as in Bird Gong No. 10, Opus 730 (1973; London, Brit. Council). Taking on the role of a disinherited shaman, Davie created a synthesis of mythologies from a variety of cultures for a modern civilisation devoid of its own village myths.\nBibliographyAlan Davie (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is one of the artist's mystical paintings which he made near the end of his life.\nThe group of six semi-abstract paintings with figures was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1928, shortly after Sims's death by suicide, and was called by his son his 'spiritual' series. The first of them was begun in 1926, in a style which was a\ndeliberate break with his preceding work, which had consisted predominantly of society portraits. The meaning of this work is nowhere precisely given, although its title, apparently invented by the artist and not a quotation, suggests the absolute power\nof God over all creation and over the destiny of the universe. It might be paraphrased as 'I am Alpha and Omega' from Revelations 1:8.The artist's unpublished papers (deposited at the Royal Academy in 1977) which give an account of his career and\nhis thoughts about art and life, contain the passage: \tThe use of mysticism is for comfort. when the world grows dim in old age. \tour senses are dulled. it is the final truth. ... Perhaps it is only in a certain \tripeness that one can\nenter this kingdom of abstractions this epitome of \tPerfection as far as we know it. ... More and more divorced from particulars. \tPersons become Types. material becomes pattern. Incidents rhythm. Colour \tindependent of the substance of\ndecoration.Also in the Royal Academy archives is a defence of Sims's state of mind in the last four months of his life, written by a Mrs Younger to the President of the Academy on 20 April 1928. She gives details of Sims's ongoing work\nand normal behaviour, but explains that he was suffering from insomnia, for which he was taking a drug: 'I write this because people are apparently trying to keep his work out of the Academy on the grounds that he was insane, and I thought you might\nlet it be known that he was never more normal.' Soon after Sims's death, his friend the artist Harold Speed wrote that these last paintings reflected his completely changed mood after he moved to London from Sussex in 1920:\tTo those who\nknew Sims they were the most poignant expression of the \tanguish he was suffering ... Technically these pictures are very interesting, as \tan attempt at abstract form and colour expression, used legitimately to express \tan abstract state of mind ... All\nthe clashing lines and jagged edges and violent \tcolours that startle one in these pictures are not a mere meaningless whim, but \ta vivid expression of a tortured state of mind ... There upon canvas was his \tpoor tortured spirit laid bare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Speed, pp.63-4)The Tate owns one of the studies for this work (Tate Gallery T07299).Further reading:Charles Sims, ed.

C.E. Commeline\u2019. At the time the portrait entered the collection, a cousin of Colonel Commeline, Mr D.A.F. Shute (correspondence in Gallery files), informed the compilers that the portrait had been brought into the family by Colonel Commeline's father's first wife Emily Charlotte Morrison, and that her grandmother was believed to have been an Ingram. \u2018Bourton-on-the-Water\u2019 is probably a mistake for \u2018Bourton-on-the-Hill\u2019, as there are no records of any Morrisons or Ingrams at the former, while the latter is near Longborough, Glos., the Commeline home, where A.C.H. Morrison, the father of Emily Charlotte, was vicar from 1846 to 1865.\n\nThe portrait is a good example of Hudson's work at the height of his popularity, when his by now somewhat old-fashioned style was about to be overtaken by the more modern and inventive approach of his former pupil Reynolds. Probably little but the face is by Hudson himself, as the glossy silks bear the stamp of a highly professional drapery painter, the best of whom at this period was Alexander Van Aken (1701\u201357). Typically, Hudson uses a pose of longstanding currency: it is a variant, in reverse, of one recorded as early as c. 1747 in the portrait of \u2018Mrs Champernoune\u2019 (Miles &amp; Simon 1979, nos.29\u201331, repr.). Two drawings of that composition were made by the then chief drapery painter to Hudson, Joseph Van Aken (c.\n1699\u20131749), presumably to serve as a model for later repetitions within the studio, with only minor alterations to allow for changes in fashion. A later close repetition of Mrs Ingram's pose, with only such minor variations as lie within the scope of a drapery painter, can be found in the portrait of \u2018Mrs Anne Istead\u2019, signed and dated 1756, now in the Vermont University collection, USA (repr.

He studied at the Edinburgh College of Art 1933\u20137 as the first Andrew Grant Scholar and then for a postgraduate year 1937\u201338, and travelled through Europe 1938\u20139. He and a fellow student Jean Bertram were married in 1941. During the Second World War he served in the army 1939\u201346, attaining the rank of major in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He joined the staff of the Tate Gallery on 3 October 1946, and was appointed Deputy Director in 1954 and Keeper in 1959. He was made an Honorary D.Litt. of the University of East Anglia in 1970; an oil painting by him \u2018Mr Pencil at Annestown\u2019 is in the Tate Gallery collection (T03478).\n\nTo mark Sir Norman's directorship the Trustees of the Tate Gallery decided as individuals, not as Trustees, to commission a portrait of him for presentation to the Gallery. The artist whom they eventually chose to paint the portrait was Lawrence Gowing, Slade Professor of Fine Art, University College, London, who served as a Trustee of the Gallery from 1953\u201360 and 1961\u201364, and worked there 1965\u201367 as Keeper of the British Collection and Deputy Director.\n\nThe portrait was painted in Gowing's studio at the Slade in the latter part of 1980. He made an oil study on canvas 14 \u00d7 10 inches, which was later rubbed down and the canvas re-used. In a letter to the compiler (8 November 1982) Gowing wrote: \u2018A few years ago shaving under a pergola at La Courni\u00e8re near Lambesc in Provence I dropped my shaving-mirror and broke it. When I picked it up the effect [of multiple images] struck me so much that I thought providence had spoken and this experience has possibly influenced self-portraits. But my first self-portrait incorporating multiple images was painted many years before [in the early 1960s]. I had already painted many pictures incorporating multiple images and one is in the Tate. The repeating lines of the elder tree in the centre of my landscape in the collection [\u2018Path with Elder and Hazel\u2019 1959 (T00475)] are in fact due to the binocular vision of vertical contours. There are many pictures like this\u2019.\n\nThe above part of the catalogue entry is based mainly on two letters of 8 November 1982 and 13 October 1983 from the artist.\n\nSir Norman Reid himself wrote of the portrait (letter of 1 November 1983): \u2018The Trustees\u2019 first choice was Graham Sutherland and he had arranged a first sitting but died before this took place. The Trustees then suggested either Gowing or Auerbach and I favoured Lawrence as I know him well...\n\n'L.G. asked two sittings only of about an hour each (I think). The first was entirely a photographic session with Lawrence snapping away with a short telephoto lens through the shattered shaving mirror at about three feet distance. The results were very interesting - nearer Cubism than Futurism, I thought.\n\n'L.G. at the 2nd sitting painted a head which he said was intended as a colour note. The portrait must have been painted largely from photographs as far as the design was concerned. There was a suggestion that we shd. paint each other (rather like Matisse and Derain if one dare make such a comparison) and I did a small drawing of Lawrence while he was painting me. There was certainly no time to do more than that.\n\n'I saw the portrait only once before it was given to the Tate. I am told it looks like me but I think it catches only the discontented side.\n\n'Perhaps I shd. add that before we began, Lawrence asked me if I wd. like one of his \u201cstraight\u201d portraits or should he follow what was interesting him most at the moment. I encouraged him to do the latter.\n\n'This note is frank and factual...But it is an accurate record of his [Lawrence Gowing's] procedure as far as my memory serves.\u2019\n\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1984\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1980", "dimensions": "Support: 660 x 451 mm", "reference": "T03208", "title": "Portrait of Sir Norman Reid", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gowing-portrait-of-sir-norman-reid-t03208", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03208_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Lawrence Gowing", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1918\u20131991", "artistbio": "\n Lawrence GOWING b. 1918\n\nPainter of landscape, portraits and still life, teacher and writer on painting.

He learnt from examples he saw in local art shops. Grimshaw gave up his work as a clerk on the railways to take up painting full-time in 1861. His first pictures were of dead birds, blossom and fruit studies. Grimshaw began to exhibit from 1862, and he showed five paintings in all at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. The culmination of this early period is Autumn Glory: The Old Mill (1869; Leeds, C.A.G.), in which all the detail of leaves, twigs, ivy and moss-covered stone is painstakingly shown. Moonlight scenes are Grimshaw's best-known subjects. This broader technique, often featuring the mysterious atmosphere of mist-laden horizons, was particularly appreciated by middle-class clients. Grimshaw's dock scenes, and the manor houses glimpsed down leafy, stone-walled suburban lanes, along which a single figure walks, were especially popular. \nIn the 1870s Grimshaw was at the peak of his success. He extended his subject-matter to include re-creations of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as producing paintings of fashionable modern women. Often he painted over photographs, and, it has been claimed, developed a technique of projecting images on to a canvas, which could then be painted. In his final years Grimshaw produced small riverscapes. During the last winter of his life he painted snow scenes. Today Grimshaw is seen as one of the minor Victorian masters, his place assured by his moonlights, evocative of Victorian life of the 1870s and 1880s.\nBibliographyAtkinson Grimshaw (exh. cat., ed.

After studying Law at Edinburgh University (1944\u20136) and London's Middle Temple (1948) Aitchison attended the Slade School of Fine Art in London (1952\u20134). His work is characterised by the use of intense, pure colour to describe shape and form in extremely spare compositions. His subject matter is traditional, featuring religious themes, landscapes, portraits and still-lifes. In 1955 Aitchison was awarded the British Council Italian Government Scholarship for painting and travelled to Italy, where the clear light and natural \u2018Biblical' landscapes had a profound influence on his work. Aitchison's religious scenes are not of an ecclesiastical discipline, but have a timeless, poetic and mysterious atmosphere reminiscent of 15th-century miniatures. In Crucifixion in a Landscape (1967\u201370; S. York priv. col.) the figure of Christ is only slightly more substantial than a mirage, denoting \u2018spiritual essence' rather than solid substance and blurring the distinction between the real and the imaginary. In his portraits colour and composition are key; Aitchison has often shown a predilection for black models, enjoying the way colour reflects against dark skin. Model Standing Against Blue Wall (1962; London, Tate) is one of the many paintings of the 1960s and 1970s of the model Georgeous Macaulay where compositional requirements take priority over truth; the figure standing in the distance is dominated and framed by the colourful abstract shapes of the background.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Back Drawing is one of a group of studies of disembodied torsos produced by the Spanish artist Juan Mu\u00f1oz during the early 1990s. This painting shows a naked back, in white chalk on a black background, sharply highlighted to accentuate contour, shadow and texture. The torso dominates the upper half of the canvas. Except for the lone hand suspended above the torso, other body parts are absent; the lower body and left arm are truncated and the shoulders form an awkward and uneven diagonal as if the figure is bending forward. In two later Back Drawings 1992 (illustrated in Wagstaff, pp.52-3) for which Mu\u00f1oz used oil pastel, the figures\u2019 aging skin and stooping shoulders are emphasised, but in this one the back, although arched and with protruding shoulder blades, has smooth flesh. The artist based this work on photographs of himself. Mu\u00f1oz commented: \u2018With the back drawings I wanted to draw the back and make it very beautiful, enticing yet giving nothing away.\u2019 (Quoted in Possible Worlds, p.58.)\n\nWhilst some of these paintings might be related to sculptures such as Backs on Bronze 1990 (illustrated in Wagstaff, p.51), others are not explicitly connected with sculpted works, and the unusually large scale of Back Drawing suggests that the artist saw it as an independent work. Indeed, Mu\u00f1oz aimed to keep his sculptures and drawings as separate entities. Back Drawing was produced at a time when Mu\u00f1oz was gaining international renown particularly as a sculptor: 1990 was the year of his first solo exhibition outside Europe at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago.\n\nBack Drawing has the stark monochromatic quality of a huge photographic negative, and the use of intense black ink suggests a connection with the artist\u2019s early interest in printmaking. Mu\u00f1oz had studied lithography and advanced printmaking when an art student in London in the 1970s, the time when he also began to experiment with sculpture. Later, the artist explained that he aimed to \u2018retain the illusionistic elements of painting and photography\u2019 for his sculptures (quoted in Juan Mu\u00f1oz, p.149). Back Drawing has a pronounced three dimensional effect achieved by the startling contrasts of light and dark, and the same supernatural and dreamlike quality that characterises much of his sculpture.\n\nMu\u00f1oz used a similarly dramatic chiaroscuro in a further series of paintings, known as the Raincoat Drawings (1988 onwards). The Raincoat Drawings (including Tate T11979) focused on eerie domestic interiors devoid of human occupants; in the Back Drawings\nMu\u00f1oz used figurative subjects but privileged form and luminescent effects over the fashioning of an identity. The absence of identity and the inability of the subject to communicate are recurrent themes in Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s sculptures and installations. His figures often face away from the viewer, challenging expectations of an \u2018exchange\u2019 between viewer and subject, as with Towards the Corner, 1998 (Tate T07872) and Shadow and Mouth, 1996 (illustrated in Wagstaff, pp.74-5). \n\nFurther reading:\nNeal Benezra and Olga M.

He was educated at Central School of Art and Design, London (1979), Croydon School of Art (1980\u201382) and the Pratt Graphic Centre, New York (1982\u20133). His work deals primarily with the figure and usually takes the form of cast sculptures and delicate drawings. Mu\u00f1oz's art seemed to derive more from a classical or Baroque sensibility than from a purely contemporary one, working within a language of interior spaces, muteness and absence. The figure sculptures are defined by a seemingly realistic rendering that harbours discrepancies such as their diminutive scale, blinded eyes or blurred faces. The drawings concentrate more on caricatures or empty rooms. His earliest sculptures took the form of balconies and banisters, placed in inappropriate places in a gallery. Only later did Mu\u00f1oz address himself directly to the human figure, rather than to its supports or its absence. Conversation Piece (1991; see 1996 exh. cat. pp. 131\u20133) consists of absurdist figures (with gigantic rotund bases in lieu of feet) placed around the gallery as if they were talking to each other or listening in on inaudible conversations. Their seeming animation serves to distance the viewer from the sculptural space rather than to include him or her in it. The same is true of Plaza (1996; see 1996 exh. cat., pp. 147\u201351), where a large crowd of oriental-looking figures with identical faces gather together in seemingly rowdy conversation, generating a tension with the silence of the piece as a whole.\nBibliographyJuan Mu\u00f1oz (exh. cat., Valencia, IVAM, Cent.

He studied first at Carmarthen Art School, and then at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, from 1906 to 1908, where he met Derwent Lees (1885\u20131931). Innes made several trips abroad in order to paint, most importantly to Collioure, France, in 1908, and again in 1911. He is, however, best known for his paintings of Wales. In 1907 he had begun a friendship with Augustus John, whose fascination with gypsies had drawn him to Wales and to a nomadic life. With John and Lees, Innes wandered over a remote and unfashionable part of North Wales in pursuit of a romantic freedom; Innes slept out of doors despite the fact that he had been diagnosed as a consumptive.In works in an essentially Post-Impressionist style such as Portrait of a Gypsy (c. 1912; Aberdeen, A.G.) Innes developed a poetic intensity comparable to that found in Samuel Palmer's work. Using a notational method and painting for the most part on a small scale, as in Bala Lake (c. 1911; Manchester, C.A.G.), he developed a style notable for its lucidity and immediacy of touch. He is most often associated with the mountain he painted repeatedly, Arenig (c. 1911\u201313; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam), on the top of which he buried a casket of love letters from Euphemia Lamb. He painted at speed, using chopped brushstrokes to render foliage, clouds or light reflections on water.

The serpent, which dwells in a cave beside a spring in the primeval forest, destroys the hero's\ncompanions when they come to collect spring water. Protected by a lion-skin and armed with a javelin, Cadmus first throws a massive boulder at the dragon, then backs it against an oak tree and spears it to death. Zuccarelli renders the scene with great\naccuracy of detail, but characteristically reduces Ovid's towering monster to proportions that do not interfere with the pleasantly Arcadian landscape, making the hero's victory reassuringly predictable. Similarly, the mangled remains of Cadmus's\nnumerous companions have been reduced to two figures lying on the ground as if asleep. The result is an attractive painting which James Barry, on seeing it at the 1765 Free Society of Artists exhibition, described as 'an exceedingly good landscape'.\nWhile enhancing its interest by the insertion of a classical subject, Zuccarelli lets the landscape element predominate.Zuccarelli was an early influence on Richard Wilson, whose later gloomy and dramatic treatment of another subject from Ovid,\nMeleager and Atalanta, 1771 (Tate Gallery T03366), while retaining much of Zuccarelli's basic compositional formula, contrasts with the latter's pleasingly coloured Rococo rendering.Zuccarelli was one of\nseveral Italian artists who travelled to England in the eighteenth century. His idealised Italian views found great favour with English audiences, and he rapidly achieved success in that country, becoming a founder-member of the Royal Academy in 1768.\nMany of his works were engraved. This painting dates from Zuccarelli's second long stay in London (1765-c.1771).Further reading:The Tate Gallery 1984-86: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1988,\np.84, reproducedE.

In Paris in 1818 Bonington enrolled at the atelier of Baron Antoine-Jean Gros, whose reputation was that of a skilled colourist and a progressive teacher. Bonington mastered the art of drawing \u00e0 la bosse and, in common with all Gros's pupils, engaged in plein-air sketching. Bonington left Gros's atelier in 1822; the teacher, after having been struck by the brilliant watercolours of his young pupil in a dealer's shop-window, declared: \u2018That man is a master.'\nFrom that moment until his death six years later, Bonington was constantly on the move. He travelled the coasts of northern France and also travelled along the Seine, making numerous watercolour studies. A sheet of small watercolour studies shows how in Paris, during the winter months, Bonington supplemented his taste for Troubadour style painting by freely copying Old Masters in the Louvre.\nIn 1825 Bonington went to London with several French artist friends including Delacroix. Following their return to Paris, Bonington and Delacroix shared a studio for a brief period, producing similar works, which were orientalising or medievalising in style and content.\nIn 1826 Bonington visited Venice. Bonington was the first to exhibit his oils publicly. Yet these oils appear laboured in comparison with the sparkling spontaneity and versatility of handling of his Italian watercolours.\nBonington's career was suddenly and tragically cut short when he died of consumption at the age of 26. The brevity and brilliance of his working life have encouraged a sentimental appreciation of his work.\nBibliographyA.

He studied at St. Martin's School of Art (1980\u201385) and Chelsea School of Art (1985\u20136). Around 1989 his early energetic, abstract landscape style became more overtly abstract. He adopted a dry-brushing technique, comparable to that developed by Gerhard Richter, to produce soft, smooth, \u2018photographic' and seductive surfaces, featuring microscopic imagery. He developed this approach throughout the 1990s, his oil paintings lacking traces of artistic activity, giving a \u2018found', depersonalised quality. Such effects suggest a disturbing, alienating connection between abstraction and technology; many of his paintings are created with a palette reduced to black and white. Source (1992; London, Tate) shows a blurred, microscopic view of sperm-like objects, characteristic of the type of scientific imagery he explored. The titles he gives to these works reflect both biological and mechanical processes. From 1994 he frequently used the motif of the black dot; in Thallophyte (1999; see 2000 exh. cat.) black dots like beads on a cord swirl around a painterly red ground. Here we can see a dialogue between the gestural abstract and microscopic imagery, the mystery of each creating a mutual metaphor; microscopism as abstraction, abstraction as microscopism. Francis is strongly influenced by his collection of images from a variety of scientific fields, including funghi, fauna, insects, geology, astronomy and medicine. In 1997 he collaborated with the conceptual artist Nicky Hirst on a project backed by the Public Art Development Trust, displaying a number of Cibachrome images in King's College Hospital, Dulwich.\nBibliographyMark Francis: Elements (exh. cat., essay A.

In 1900 she was elected the first woman member of the New English Art Club. Her works displayed a vibrancy of colour and spontaneity of composition without any apparent interest in the scientific aspects of Impressionist colour theory. Particularly successful are her precise and uncluttered drawings and her portraits of women, which often had a dominant key of brilliant colour.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n During the early 1960s, British born painter Richard Smith made paintings that combined aspects of British Pop Art with those of American abstraction. In Panatella 1961(Tate T01199), Smith combined veiled reference to popular, everyday subject matter with painterly technique. Blowing up the tiny logo from a cigar wrapper to monumental, billboard like proportions, Smith explored the methods employed by the mass media to transform ordinary products into desirable, fashionable commodities. The layered paint surface of the image appears to radiate light as if it were a glowing cinema screen or a Byzantine icon. Such handling of paint subtly enhances the painting's allure.\n\nPanatella was painted while Smith was in New York on a two year Harkness Fellowship. Returning to London in 1961, he continued to explore the interface between the methods of advertising and abstract, modernist painting. Rather than focusing on images drawn from popular culture as he had done, Smith began to concentrate on packaging itself. This led to a fascination with boxes, particularly cigarette boxes. In 1962 he made a film called Trailer which featured close-ups of cigarette packs, repeated and seen from different angles. At about this time cigarette packs seen in isomorphic perspective began to appear in his paintings. In 1966, discussing his interest in packaging he wrote:\n\nThe kind of images I was using then were based on cartons, or boxes. The carton is an incessant theme in present-day civilisation: shops are full of boxes and you see these before you see the goods; they practically stand in for the goods - it is not just a question of labelling or depiction. Everything comes in boxes: you buy boxes when you are shopping, you do not buy visible goods; you don't buy cigarettes, only cartons. The box is your image of the product.'(Quoted in Robertson, p.11.)\n\nVista develops these preoccupations and, like Smith's earlier work, it is a large, colourful billboard-like painting which concentrates upon a single motif. The image of a cigarette pack viewed from above is repeated in sequence. This creates an illusion of depth or recession, one pack seeming to stand inside another. Employing the simple presentational technique of increasing scale, the boxes appear to zoom forwards towards the spectator, Smith mimicing advertising techniques which aggressively seek to grab the attention of the viewer. The colour scheme of the painting serves to enhance this effect, the bright red of the first box leaping forwards, and the blue tones of the boxes behind seeming to recede. \n\nHowever, in order to enhance the zoom effect and concentrate more exclusively on the cigarette pack motif, Smith shaped the canvas, adding a painted extension to the rectangular canvas. The extension was also intended to suggest the shadow cast by the last box. In an unpublished Tate interview of 1967 he stated: 'This was the first painting with an extension, an extension of pretty modest dimensions. These extensions were introduced as a way of tailoring the canvas shape to the canvas image. The base canvas always remained rectangular and the extension tended to repeat the drawn shape within that \u2026The basic image is the front view of a box with the shadow of the box extending to the next depiction of the box and its shadow extending to the next and so on.' \n\nVista was one of the first paintings in which Smith began to explore the relation between two and three dimensions, painting and sculpture, illusion and reality. Continuing to focus on packaging while employing a painterly approach, Smith would further develop the shaped canvasses until they became fully three dimensional, thus further undermining the distinction between painting and sculpture.\n\nFurther Reading:David Mellor, The Sixties Art Scene in London, exhibition catalogue, Barbican Art Gallery, London 1993, pp.124-131Marco Livingstone, Pop Art: A Continuing History, London 1990, pp.109-111Bryan Robertson, Richard Smith Paintings 1958-1966, exhibition catalogue, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 1966, reproduced p.31Richard Smith, Seven Exhibitions 1961-1975, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1975\n\nImogen Cornwall-Jones October 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1963", "dimensions": "Support: 2132 x 3174 x 160 mm", "reference": "T00855", "title": "Vista", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/smith-vista-t00855", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00855_8.jpg", "artist": "Richard Smith", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1931", "artistbio": "\n English painter and printmaker. He studied at the Royal College of Art, London, from 1954 to 1957, and from 1959 to 1961 lived in New York on a Harkness Fellowship, producing paintings that combined the formal qualities of the work of American abstract painters, with references to American commercial culture, with its lush seductive colours, exploitation of magnification and soft-focus effects and, generally, its stimulation of desire and fantasy. His ambition to make painting share a common sensibility with media outside conventional fine art, such as film and photography, began to wane by 1968.\nSmith's influential use of shaped canvases sometimes physically extended into space and initially referred to devices used in advertising to promote products and to overpower and entice the spectator. Gradually such direct references were minimised in favour of the largely self-contained abstract qualities of shape, support, colour and surface. Repetition suggests some response to Minimalism, although he resisted the call to new materials, comparing his cutting and folding of canvas to large-scale origami, and often using sequential changes to suggest the passage of time, as in a diary or calendar.\nBulky constructions such as these were followed from 1972 by paintings using components of tent manufacture (aluminium tubes, canvas and string), their structures often resembling kites. These paintings focused on the physical constitution of painting as a stretched and suspended surface, playing with relationships of colour and shape, drawing and structure. After resettling in New York in 1976, Smith's \u2018kites' evolved into larger-scale architectural decoration, often in response to commissions.\nBibliographyRichard Smith: Paintings, 1958\u20131966 (exh. cat. by B.

Hodgkins 1977 \n\nTypically of John Wells, a wide range of different techniques has been employed in the painting of Microcosm. As in Painting, 1957, the artist has applied a series of superimposed oil glazes on to a white ground. These have been abraded and scratched with a blade and sandpaper so that under-lying layers of paint are revealed and the surface becomes a complex pattern of swirling incisions. As a result the picture has a range of matt and glossy surface effects and a sense of depth and luminosity. Wells again used a geometric grid to generate an abstract pattern into which he inserted areas of strong colour. \n\nHowever, in contrast to Painting, 1957, Wells then added some more painterly touches. He told the Tate Gallery (in conversation, 8 Nov. 1977) that the black and white swirls on the left hand side were applied using an 'oil and wax off-set' technique. Oil paint, mixed with wax to make it slow drying, was painted onto waxed paper and then transferred to the painting by drawing the pattern on the back of the paper. As a result the lines are impasted but flattened off. The central area of burnt sienna that dominates the picture appears to have been applied with a knife. This area obscures much of the underlying abstract pattern, so the red triangle near the middle of the picture would appear to have been added last to draw the composition together. Though dated '1957-59', the execution of this work is unlikely to have taken place throughout that period. It was common practice for Wells to make minor adjustments to works some time after he originally painted them and that is most probably the case here. \n\nIn 1977 Wells said (ibid.) that the picture's mounting board should be considered to be an integral part of the work. This is consistent with the fact that the board appears to have been painted after the main support was attached to it. In addition, the main painted board is of uneven proportions, it being 1/4 inch wider at the top. Wells thought it unlikely that his use of old boards reflected the influence of Alfred Wallis, suggesting it was more probably the need to 'just get on with it as quick as you can'. \n\nWells said in 1977 (ibid.) that the imagery of Microcosm\nwas based on an imaginary landscape and was not intended to evoke anything specific. He also thought that it had probably been one of a series. Microcosm\nwould appear to fall between Wells's abstract work and his more literal depictions of landscape. The image has been generated in much the same way as in Painting, 1957. However, the rich red and brown colouring of Microcosm\nis seen in a number of more representational landscapes of the late 1950s, like Tin Country, 1959 (private collection), in which it suggests the staining of the iron ore which is a characteristic of Cornish cliffs. In addition, the sense of a foreground at the bottom of Microcosm, achieved by the apparent recession of the diagonal lines, recalls a painting like Vista, 1955 (repr. Studio, June 1959, p.191). Vista\nis remarkable in that one apparently sees a landscape as if moving above it, suggesting that it might relate to Wells's interest in flying. During the war Wells had been pleased to learn from the RAF pilots that a painting of his based upon rock pools also looked like the Isles of Scilly seen from the air. In January 1993 he told the compiler that he liked the idea of formal consistency between microcosm and macrocosm and, later, thought a similar idea might have been in his mind when he titled this work. \n\nProvenance:\nPurchased by Miss E.M.

Though his only formal artistic training was from night classes at St Martin's School of Art during 1927-8, he exhibited in the 'Daily Express' Young Artists Exhibition at the Royal Society of British Artists in 1927. During a visit to Cornwall in 1928 he studied briefly with Stanhope Forbes in Newlyn and was introduced to Ben and Winifred Nicholson and Christopher Wood, then staying, along with Marcus and Irene Brumwell, in Feock. He was in contact with Nicholsonthroughout the 1930s, though work prevented him from making more than the occasional visit to his Hampstead studio. He qualified as a doctor in 1930 and, after working in a number of hospitals, was the GP for the Scilly Isles from 1936 to 1945. During the war he was able to make occasional visits to Nicholson and Hepworth in St Ives where he also met Naum Gabo, who became a major and lasting influence upon him. At the end of the war, with a new confidence in his recent work, he chose to pursue a career as a full-time artist, buying one of Forbes's former studios in Newlyn.Though living in Newlyn, Wells was at the centre of artistic activity in post-war St Ives. He was a founder member of the Crypt Group in 1946 and of the Penwith Society of Arts in Cornwall in 1949. He shared an exhibition with Winifred Nicholson at the Lefevre Gallery, London, in 1946, showed at Downing's Bookshop in St Ives in July 1947 (with Hepworth, Nicholson and Lanyon) and June 1949 (with Sven Berlin and David Haughton), at the Salon des R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Nouvelles, Paris, in 1949, at the 1951 Sao Paolo Biennale and at the Durlacher Gallery, New York, in 1952, 1958 and 1960. During the 1950s he was included in mixed exhibitions in Britain and abroad and, in 1958, was awarded the Art Critics' Prize, British Section, by the International Association of Art Critics. However, always a diffident figure, Wells resisted joining a gallery until, in 1960, the Waddington Galleries gave him his first one-person exhibition in London. Despite the success of that show, a second in 1964, in which Wells showed more 'austere', 'hard-edged' work, roused scant interest amongst critics or\ncollectors. In 1965 Wells acquired a second studio in Newlyn which he shared for nearly thirty years with the sculptor Denis Mitchell. After 1964 his work had little exposure outside Cornwall until the revival of interestin St Ives artists, marked most clearly by the Tate Gallery's 1985 exhibition St Ives: 25 Years of Painting, Sculpture and Pottery, which included seven works by Wells. Although critical opinion of Wells's work has varied, AlanBowness suggested in 1972 that his 'paintings and constructions ... have a purity and a quality that substantiate the claim that he is the most neglected major figure of the period' (Decade 40's: Painting, Sculpture and Drawing inBritain 1940-49, exh. cat., Arts Council 1972).

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nThis medium-size oil painting by the French artist Odilon Redon depicts a vase of flowers on the left side of the composition and a woman\u2019s head and shoulders shown in profile on the right, facing the vase. The woman wears a patterned headscarf, and the back of her head and the lower part of her body are cropped out of the scene at the edges of the canvas. The vase and the woman are shown quite close up and therefore seem to occupy the foreground of the scene, but the pictorial space in this painting remains ambiguous due to the fact that it has no discernible setting \u2013 only a flat, mottled yellow-ochre background. Although the artist has used strong tones of red, blue, orange, purple and dark green paint to depict the woman and the vase of flowers, the ochre background shows through this paint in several areas, which has the effect of placing all of the elements of the scene onto a single flat plane. Redon\u2019s name is inscribed onto the painting at the bottom left corner of the painting.\nThe work was made when the artist was living and working in Paris, and although the exact date for the painting is unknown, it is thought to have been produced between 1895 and 1905. To make the work, the artist applied oil paint directly onto to an unprimed linen canvas. Redon did not varnish the painting when it was complete, and as a result the ochre background colour that dominates the painting has faded over time. The original background would have been brighter and would perhaps have communicated a livelier tone. Although descriptive, the painting\u2019s title does not indicate the woman\u2019s identity, whether the artist knew her or if she was in fact fictional, nor is there a clear indication of her relationship to the vase of flowers.\n\nProfile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers was made at a time of change in Redon\u2019s practice. From 1890 onwards the artist had moved from producing predominantly monochromatic prints, drawings and paintings towards the introduction of colour into his work. Furthermore, new motifs such as flowers began to appear regularly in his paintings. Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers is one of a number of works Redon produced around the turn of the twentieth century that feature flowers and a female head, such as his pastels Sita 1895 (Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois) and Portrait of Violette Heymann of 1910 (Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio).\nAlthough the scene in Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers remains ambiguous, there are clear formal resonances between the woman and the vase: for instance, the shape created by the flower heads and petals is reflected in the floral pattern on the fabric of the woman\u2019s scarf, and the smooth, rounded contours of her profile are echoed by the curved sides of the vase. In this sense, there is a decorative appearance to the painting that may reflect the fact that around this time Redon had begun to take up commissions for the painting of murals and screens. For instance, the series of murals he completed in 1910\u201311 for the library at Fontfroide Abbey near Narbonne in southern France features veiled women and natural forms such as flowers, trees and butterflies presented against gold-yellow backgrounds in a similar manner to Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers.\nThe dream-like, almost melancholic atmosphere of paintings such as Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers is typical of the symbolist style of painting for which Redon is well known. Redon did not identify himself as belonging to any symbolist literary or artistic group (see Hauptman 2005, p.34), but he was nonetheless an important influence on a younger generation of artists such as the Nabis, a group of post-impressionist painters whose style incorporated decorative and symbolist elements, both of which can be seen in Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers.\n\nFurther reading\nCarolyn Keay (ed.), Odilon Redon, New York 1977, reproduced p.45.Odilon Redon, To Myself: Notes on Life, Art and Artists, New York 1986.Jodi Hauptman, Beyond the Visible: The Art of Odilon Redon, exhibition catalogue, Museum of Modern Art, New York 2005.\nLouise HughesNovember 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1895\u20131905", "dimensions": "Support: 655 x 505 mm", "reference": "T05524", "title": "Profile of a Woman with a Vase of Flowers", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/redon-profile-of-a-woman-with-a-vase-of-flowers-t05524", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05524_8.jpg", "artist": "Odilon Redon", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1840\u20131916", "artistbio": "\n French printmaker, draughtsman and painter. Early developments matured into an active artistic career only after the Franco-Prussian War, in which Redon served as a soldier. He regarded this experience as the catalyst that finally produced in him a firm sense of vocation. He settled in Paris. He was by then producing large numbers of highly original charcoal drawings, which he called his Noirs. They evoke a mysterious world of subjective, often melancholic fantasy. \nLithographs formed a major part of Redon's production. But he also developed the potential for links with the written word in titles and captions. Above all he displayed in his lithographs audacious imagery that made the visionary seem plausible. \nAlthough his Noirs made little impact on the general public, they won acclaim in the Parisian literary avant-garde. The aesthetic principles underlying Redon's art were close to those of Baudelaire. Redon was considered the major Symbolist artist. \nRedon's reputation until 1890 rested entirely on work in black and white, but he had been using colour in unexhibited landscape studies. During the 1890s he used colour alongside monochrome, colour gradually becoming dominant. The transformation of nature into dream-like images, suggesting indefinite states of mind and expressed in sumptuous textures, remained his central concern.\nAfter Redon's death, his family and friends completed a project that he had instigated: the publication of selections from his writings under the title A soi-m\u00eame (1922). It demonstrates Redon's considerable skills as a writer as well as providing valuable insights into his work.\nBibliographyA.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Who\u2019s Afraid of the Dark? is a rectangular canvas coated with a combination of flies and resin. The canvas was primed with black acrylic primer before the dead houseflies and clear resin mixture was poured onto it. This method of application resulted in an uneven surface with different levels and a variation in colour caused by the different fly parts (red, brown, black and white). The painting\u2019s overall colour is a rich brown-black. The resin mixture increases the natural glossiness of the flies, with the result that the surface coating has a sticky appearance reminiscent of tar or toffee.\n\nHirst made his first fly painting, Untitled Black Monochrome (Without Emotion), in 1997. At this point, he had not yet perfected the technique of mixing flies with resin, and the painting smelled so bad that the Italian designer Miuccia Prada who had bought it could not keep it in her house. Hirst did not create another fly painting until 2002, when he made Who\u2019s Afraid of the Dark?. The following year, he titled a series of rectangular fly paintings with the names of diseases and disasters \u2013 Aids, Typhoid, Genocide and Holocaust (reproduced in Cicelyn, Codognato and D\u2019Argenzio, pp.86\u20137) \u2013 before developing the theme with the circular Black Sun 2004 (reproduced in Gregor Muir and Clarrie Wallis, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, exhibition catalogue, Tate Britain, London 2004, pp.8\u20139) and the diamond-shaped Infanticide 2006 (White Cube, London). Hirst has claimed that it was seeing the paintstick drawings of Richard Serra (born 1939) that encouraged him to return to the fly paintings in 2002 (Cicelyn, Codognato and D\u2019Argenzio, pp.86 and 94). Serra\u2019s paintstick drawings, begun in the late 1980s, feature large monochrome black squares that developed in the second half of the 1990s to thickly textured black circles, known as Rounds. However where Serra\u2019s drawings, true to the minimalist tradition to which his sculpture belongs, refer only to their own formal properties, Hirst\u2019s use of flies is viscerally and emotively charged. After the title of his first fly painting \u2013 which makes explicit the relationship between the minimalist structure and the affective content \u2013 he abandoned the reference to form and celebrated the emotionally-loaded title. For him, flies are metaphors for human beings: \u2018if you stand back far enough you think people are just like flies, like the cycle of a fly is like your own life\u2019 (quoted in Cicelyn, Codognato and D\u2019Argenzio, p.94). He has used the words of philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) in his famous text Leviathan (1651) as a reference for his fly paintings: \u2018No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death: and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\u2019 (Quoted in Cicelyn, Codognato and D\u2019Argenzio, p.94.) Hobbes\u2019s words describe the fate of man in a world without government, in a condition which he calls the \u2018state of nature\u2019, the darker side of which flies appropriately represent.\n\nFlies initially featured in one of Hirst\u2019s most famous and groundbreaking works, A Thousand Years 1990, as an expression of repetitive and pointless mortality. In the two adjoining chambers of a glass-walled vitrine, a rotting cow\u2019s head hosted a colony of flies that feed, breed and potentially died on the suspended Insect-O-Cutor that hung over the dead head. The year after this work was exhibited at the Saatchi Gallery in London, where the painter Francis Bacon (1909\u201392) admired it, Hirst created his first solo exhibition using the pupae of exotic butterflies. Entitled In and Out of Love, the exhibition centred on a room hung with blank canvases from which Malaysian butterflies hatched before briefly fluttering around the room, feeding on pot plants and eventually dying. Hirst created his first butterfly paintings for this event using household gloss paint in which the isolated butterflies appear trapped. In contrast to the canvases encrusted with flies, the butterfly paintings, made using brightly coloured paint to offset the brilliantly shimmering wings, have titles that refer to love either directly or obliquely: I\u2019m in Love 1994\u20135, She Loves You 1997, Girl 1997, Another Girl 1997 and Beautiful Feeling 1997 (reproduced in Cicelyn, Codognato and D\u2019Argenzio, pp.79, 91\u20133 and 95).\n\nHirst has compared the relationship between life and death to that between the colours white and black (Adrian Dannatt, \u2018Damien Hirst: Life\u2019s like this, then it stops\u2019, Flash Art, no.169, March\u2013April 1993, p.63). Heaven Above, Hell Below 2003 (White Cube, London), a rectangular canvas half covered with an encrustation of white pills, the other half covered in flies, embodies this dualistic vision. Continuing this, in 2007, as a companion piece to his platinum and diamond covered skull entitled For the Love of God, Hirst created twenty-five versions of a human skull coated in flies and resin entitled The Fear of Death (White Cube, London). His butterfly painting, Monument to the Living and the Dead 2006 (AR00045), elaborates this theme with exotic butterflies immersed in household gloss paint on two adjoining panels, one white and one black. \n\nFurther reading:\nSarah Thornton, \u2018In and out of love with Damien Hirst\u2019, The Art Newspaper, issue 195 (October 2008), http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=16269\n\n,\naccessed 16 April 2009.\nEduardo Cicelyn, Mario Codognato and Mirta D\u2019Argenzio, Damien Hirst, exhibition catalogue, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples 2004, pp.86\u201394.\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nSeptember 2009\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Flies and resin on canvas on fibreboard", "date": "2002", "dimensions": "Image: 2140 x 1067 x 55 mm", "reference": "T12750", "title": "Who\u2019s Afraid of the Dark?", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hirst-whos-afraid-of-the-dark-t12750", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12750_8.jpg", "artist": "Damien Hirst", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1965", "artistbio": "\n English sculptor, installation artist, painter and printmaker. He was a leading figure in the group of \u2018Young British Artists'. He studied at Goldsmiths College, London (1986\u20139), and in 1988 curated the exhibition Freeze. His works are explicitly concerned with the fundamental dilemmas of human existence; his constant themes have included the fragility of life, society's reluctance to confront death, and the nature of love and desire, often clothed in titles which exist somewhere between the naive and the disingenuous.\nDead animals are frequently used in Hirst's installations, forcing viewers to consider their own and society's attitudes to death. Containers such as aquariums and vitrines are used as devices to impose control on the fragile subject-matter contained within them and as barriers between the viewer and the viewed. The animals are preserved as in life, but at the same time are emphatically dead, with their entrails and flesh exposed.\nHirst's paintings can be seen as a foil to his sculptural work, though they are similarly inconclusive. The \u2018spot' paintings are named after pharmaceutical stimulants and narcotics, the chemical enhancers of human emotion, and yet take the form of mechanical and unemotional Minimalist paintings. Their detachment is further emphasised by the exploitation of procedures that can be simply carried out by assistants under his instruction. Hirst's interest in contemporary society is further reflected in collaborative pop music projects and in his designs for the Pharmacy and Quo Vadis restaurants, London. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 1995.\nBibliographyFreeze (exh. cat., London, Surrey Docks, 1988) Damien Hirst (exh. cat., essay C.

At this period his work has a fluidity and a freedom of handling that is closer to Richard Parkes Bonington than to the prevailing style of Victorian watercolours. Around 1852 he came under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite movement and radically altered his style. \nIt is not known how Inchbold met the Pre-Raphaelites, but the Rossettis knew him well, and he became a close friend of Algernon Charles Swinburne. John Everett Millais admired his work. Inchbold's pictures soon attracted the attention of John Ruskin, and in 1858 he visited Switzerland to paint alpine subjects under Ruskin's supervision. From this point onwards Inchbold's painting changed direction, possibly as a reaction against the bullying he had received from Ruskin. Visits to Venice in 1862 and the following years resulted in a series of ethereal pictures painted with the freedom of his early works and entirely lacking the highly finished technique of his Pre-Raphaelite pictures. \nInchbold never married and seems to have had a rather melancholy life. Dante Gabriel Rossetti complained that he was a bore, and Swinburne wrote, \u2018He had not many friends, being very shy and rather brusque in manner, so that people were apt to think him odd.'

He completed his studies at Belfast College of Art and from 1931 to 1935 at the Royal Academy Schools in London.\nWhile serving in the army from 1942 to 1946 he made only a few watercolours of soldiers and the local landscape. He returned to painting in earnest in 1946, concentrating on still-lifes of pots and saucepans, eggs, fishes and bottles on a bare kitchen table. He chose these objects simply because they provided contrasting shapes that he could arrange against simple backgrounds, often to elegant effect. By 1951 the forms had begun to take on a life of their own, sometimes as metaphors of erotic encounters between male and female. Some of his works of 1952\u20134 became completely abstract.\nThis phase of Scott's work came to an end partly as a result of a visit in 1953 to the USA, where he met Pollock, Rothko and Kline. He felt that he belonged to the European tradition of Chardin, C\u00e9zanne and Bonnard, and this led to a gradual return to a more representational style. Gradually, however, he moved again towards abstraction.\nIn the late 1960s he reintroduced objects such as frying pans and saucepans juxtaposed with purely abstract forms; the picture space was kept deliberately flat and the forms carefully spaced in floating rows. In both paintings and prints he sometimes produced variations of almost identical arrangements of forms in completely different colours, continuing to use still-life subjects as the starting-point for otherwise self-sufficient formal relationships.\nBibliographyA.

'I have painted two such paintings [the other being \"A Punta\", no.34 in the same exhibition] ... but I have in mind more of them. Not really as a series but as various attempts to achieve a certain degree of severe but sensual clarity and physical dignity by the use of strong, abstract colors in a certain sequence and scale. Like an heraldic flag or something which is physically emanating a strong severe impact inviting to look in depth and feel some presence, some convincing fact confronting the viewer with its physical evidence, characters and qualities. I will say more about this later. I have of course painted some smaller pictures on the same theme which don't come off at all with the same effect for obvious reasons of scale.\n\n'\"A punta\" in Italian means \"pointed\" or \"sharp\" that is hostile or \"on the alert\" or ready to push back or repel, let's say also \"not easy to get\" unless you are aware that the point is there; the opposite of \"smooth\" or \"round\" or \"soft\", \"on guard\" and so on ... I have kept this expression \"a punta\" in mind for some time and when I had to title these pictures it came back to me as conveying a mood or a state of mind somehow akin to the image or the mood which the picture gave me once I saw it completed ...\n\n'The elements I was trying to see in these two large pictures are: 1) A possibility of attempting some perception of depth through a still composition where movement or rather rhythm would be provided by a succession of colors. A kind of depth as a reversible dimension and direction, a sense of existence in some other direction than in height or length but in a non measurable non definite direction. A purely perceptual depth not an illusion of depth ... I sense something of value there, some possibility of seeing and perceiving beyond the two dimensional modern tradition. Space and light, structure and color etc. 2) Thus the optical effect would be to convey this perceptual depth through light displayed in a succession of transparent color bands organized in an easily readable structural combination from the ground to the final surface of the painting all throughout this bidimensional surface itself.\n\n'I used a dark ground and intense deep colors for the first time in these two paintings and this conveys a sense of severe stillness rather than sensual or joyous movement as in some other paintings involving the same attempt but by another technique and approach. These other previous attempts did not achieve as much because of their color scale that was in a way too open, mobile and not still, deep or severe or austere enough as in \"Molto a punta\". Technically I tried to give oil painting the aspect of a solid mural painted on a live material (like canvas) rather than its conventional although modern look. I tried to keep the color intense but transparent and light conveying as much as possible the natural qualities of such medium. I tried very hard to make a succession of colors work in a sequence of bands on a deep blue ground in such a way that they would not be segregated from the ground but trying to make them work together with it.'\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.175-6, reproduced p.175\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1965", "dimensions": "Support: 1556 x 2349 mm", "reference": "T00804", "title": "Very Sharp", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dorazio-very-sharp-t00804", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00804_8.jpg", "artist": "Piero Dorazio", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1927\u20132005", "artistbio": "\n Piero Dorazio born 1927Italian abstract painter, born in Rome.

The other picture seen from the right, Vizzavona photo 41512, is now in the Brodie Castle collection, Scotland. \n\nThe Tate's work is very close in composition to Nos.502 and 503 except that the latter both include a man fishing from a small boat in the middle distance and lack the boats moored to the near bank. If No.502 is a morning effect and No.503 is a sunlight one probably about mid-day, the Tate's picture would seem to be an overcast effect in the afternoon. The view is looking to the south-east. \n\nThough the picture bought by the Tate was dated 1880 when exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in 1927, the handling suggests a later date. The artist's widow and daughter Marguerite were certain that Guillaumin did not visit Moret in that year and that he was there in 1902. 'I am absolutely sure of this date of 1902', wrote Mlle Guillaumin (letter of 12 December 1954), 'for, as a child, I was there convalescing, and my father, who was an excellent father, installed himself there at the time not to leave me on my own'. No.503 was dated 1902 when reproduced in the Fine Arts Journal, XXX, 1914, p.57 and another picture of Moret, 'Moret. Railway Bridge', was also dated 1902 when shown at the Salon d'Automne in 1926 (2454). According to Gray, Guillaumin was at Moret in the spring of that year. \n\nThere are many pictures of the same bridge by Sisley, who died at Moret in 1899. \n\nThe Tate's work is not included in the first volume of the Guillaumin catalogue raisonn\u00e9, but will be included in a second volume or supplement. It was entitled 'The Mills at Moret' when exhibited at the Leicester Galleries, the mills being the low buildings on the left. \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, p.345, reproduced p.345\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1902", "dimensions": "Support: 600 x 730 mm", "reference": "N04824", "title": "Moret-sur-Loing", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guillaumin-moret-sur-loing-n04824", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N04/N04824_8.jpg", "artist": "Armand Guillaumin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1841\u20131927", "artistbio": "\n Armand Guillaumin 1841-1927French Impressionist painter in oil and pastel, mainly of\nlandscape subjects; occasional etcher and lithographer.

In 1957 he married Nancy Minto and the following year they moved to New York. Dine's first involvement with the art world was in his Happenings of 1959\u201360. \nClothing and domestic objects featured prominently in Dine's paintings of the 1960s, with a range of favoured motifs. He was equally preoccupied with the elements of his own profession. \nDine's method involved repeating his theme again and again, often in several mediums. Through a process of exploration and reinvention the common image lost its place in the public domain and was stamped exclusively with the artist's signature, becoming his vehicle for communicating a range of emotional and aesthetic intentions.Thus, Dine has often been out-of-step with the major movements of the post-World War II period and must be considered a modern individualist. \nLater in the 1960s and in the 1970s Dine consciously refined his draughtsmanship and painterly techniques, taking greater care and control to achieve a quieter, more romantic and sensual effect. In the 1980s he found increased confidence with greater emphasis on the grand gesture, yet a more sombre tone.\nDine is an unusually prolific artist, producing large numbers of paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures of diverse scale, as well as illustrated books and stage design. He often visits printshops and foundries and has set up dozens of temporary studios in cities all over the USA and Europe in order to focus on special projects or to prepare exhibitions.\nBibliographyJim Dine Designs for \u2018A Midsummer Night's Dream' (New York, 1968)J.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nThe life-size portrait shows Lieutenant-Colonel Bryce McMurdo in a Scottish landscape setting. Little is known of the sitter but for the fact that he lived at Mavis Grove near Dumfries and married Jane Otway of Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1802. This full-length portrait may have been painted not long after his marriage. McMurdo is shown fishing on the banks of a stream. Wallets for storing fishing tackle can be seen in his upturned hat while between his feet rests a small basket or creel for keeping live fish.\nSir Henry Raeburn was largely a self-taught artist who, after an apprenticeship with a goldsmith, set himself up in Edinburgh and by 1776 was painting portraits in oils. He visited London in 1785 and went to Italy that same year with letters of introduction from Sir Joshua Reynolds. After a two-year sojourn he returned to Edinburgh where he soon established himself as Scotland\u2019s leading portrait painter. In the 1790s and early 1800s, when this painting was executed, Raeburn commanded a near monopoly over Edinburgh\u2019s fashionable portrait production. However, there is evidence of considerable conflict with other local artists and, despite his success, Raeburn was declared bankrupt in 1808. Bryce McMurdo\u2019s portrait may date from the flurry of professional activity that followed this misfortune. The difficulty of pinpointing the exact chronology of Raeburn\u2019s paintings can be attributed largely to the fact that he rarely dated his work and that none of his sitter books or ledgers survive. Yet it also owes much to the fact that Raeburn painted concurrently with a variety of different techniques.\nThis painting demonstrates the artist\u2019s wide vocabulary of brushstrokes; from the broad application of light and shade on McMurdo\u2019s clothing to the fine detail of his wicker creel; from the horizontal dragging of dry white paint to suggest the water\u2019s shimmering surface to the feathery wet-on-wet strokes used to depict the sitter\u2019s hair. \n\nFurther reading\nViccy Coltman and Stephen Lloyd (eds.), Henry Raeburn: Context, Reception and Reputation, Edinburgh 2012.\nRuth KennySeptember 2013\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1800\u201310", "dimensions": "Support: 2400 x 1480 mm", "reference": "N01435", "title": "Lieut-Colonel Bryce McMurdo", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/raeburn-lieut-colonel-bryce-mcmurdo-n01435", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01435_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Henry Raeburn", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1756\u20131823", "artistbio": "\n Scottish painter.

He was warned against the unsympathetic lower galleries, but recalled:\n\n\nI had not painted for some time and had only a few colours which were usable, but I had begun to make my first \u2018Chance and order\u2019 paintings, taking a different colour for each painting. Then when these first six were hung in the small rooms downstairs with no more than one to a wall, they and the rooms came to life.[1]\n\n\nAll of the continuing series were derived from the similarly entitled series of drawings of 1969-72, to which Chance and Order Group VII, Drawing 6 and Chance and Order Group VIII, Drawing 6 belong (Tate T01847 and T01848). Chance and Order 10 (Monastral Blue) was the tenth of the paintings and derived from Chance and Order Group X, Drawing 3, which is inscribed \u2018drawing for painting in blue\u2019.[2] Group X gathered the most complex drawings, in which parallel lines were drawn between sixty-four points on a seven by seven grid. The points were selected and paired at random, and their arrangement listed in an accompanying chart of four columns of eight pairs. Lines were drawn between the points on the drawing following a sequence reading across all four columns of the chart; the same sequence of reading was used for the addition of lines to the original until the eighth pair in each column had eight lines each. This additive system allowed the suggestion of time, as established lines remained uninterrupted by those that came after. Unlike the earlier drawings held by the Tate in which the lines were filled to make painted bands, on Chance and Order 10 (Monastral Blue) it was the lines themselves which were coloured; their stepped junctions helped to emphasise the interweaving.\n\n\nAccording to the artist\u2019s comments provided for Tate Gallery Report 1972-4,[3] the painting was made alongside Chance and Order 11 (Cobalt Blue) 1972 (private collection, Germany),[4] which derived from Chance and Order Group X, Drawing 6.[5] The simultaneous use of blues was not coincidental as most of the paintings in the sequence used single colours \u2018taken from the palette and then not used for any subsequent painting\u2019.[6] The procedure was to draw the lines in pencil on the squared-up and primed canvas; in order to accommodate the composition - which had spilled over the drawing\u2019s seven by seven grid - the canvas grid was nine by nine. The application of paint closely followed the drawing: \u2018The lines were painted first - in monastral blue - and the rest of the canvas white. A simultaneous process followed in which white and blue were continually repainted until clarity and richness were achieved\u2019.[7] This process, which was common to the rest of the sequence, intensified the colour contrast but resulted in a rough surface with rather uneven edges to the lines, reminiscent of Seventeen Lines (Tate T00751).\n\n\nLike the composition, Martin\u2019s dense paintwork recalled Mondrian\u2019s carefully balanced De Stijl paintings which betrayed their adjustments through the heavy working of the surface. The strength of colour on white may also be seen in the context of the painting of Martin\u2019s younger contemporaries, especially the optical abstraction of Bridget Riley. More broadly, his programmed use of chance has been related by Jeffrey Steele to the chance work of composers such as John Cage and Howard Skempton.[8]\n\n\nMatthew Gale\nOctober 1997\n\n\n[1] Kenneth Martin, Chance and Order: The Sixth William Townsend Lecture, London 1979, p.21.\n\n[2] Reproduced in Andrew Forge and Hilary Lane, Chance and Order, Drawings by Kenneth Martin, London 1973, p.73.\n\n[3] Tate Gallery Report 1972-4, London 1975, p.198.\n[4]\nReproduced in Kenneth Martin, Chance Order Change, London 1983, p.[10], fig.9.\n[5] Reproduced in Forge and Lane 1973, p.75.\n[6] Tate Gallery Report, p.198.\n[7]\nIbid.\n\n[8] Jeffrey Steele, \u2018Chance, Change, Choice and Order: A Structural Analysis of a Work by Kenneth Martin\u2019, Leonardo, vol.24, no.4, 1991, p.409.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1972", "dimensions": "Support: 914 x 914 mm", "reference": "T01849", "title": "Chance and Order, Change 6 (Monastral Blue)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/martin-chance-and-order-change-6-monastral-blue-t01849", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01849_8.jpg", "artist": "Kenneth Martin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1905\u20131984", "artistbio": "\n Kenneth MARTIN b. 1905\n\nAbstract artist in painting and constructions.

I had no pre-existing model from which to work. My approach to the unknown was through numerous automatic drawings that were distilled on to canvas. The painting began with lines and blank space, the lines were then integrated with space, by giving off light on one side and by being dark on the other. From this base, the painting slowly grew out of itself. Each part was an invention that did not become clear until it was down on the canvas. I had the impression that, in venturing into the inner worlds, nothing was lost. All was there, but seen in a new way, a merging and interlacing of sky, mountains, plants and creatures.\n\n'In writing of the inner-worlds, words say too much in that they have associations with the known, words say too little in that they are inadequate to express a new kind of reality.\n\n'The painting took about six months of continuous work. Two versions were kept going at the same time, a clarification in one version led to a further clarification in the other. In their final state the two paintings were far from identical. The other version belonged to Wolfgang Paalen. He informed me a few months before his tragic death in 1959, that it had perished in a disaster about which he had not the heart to talk.\n\n'This painting is a sequel to \u201cThe Circuit of the Light Knight through the Dark Queen\u201d, 1942. Here, the Queen has a halo-crowned head and a glowing crater, her body extends to form a landscape embellished with jewels and objects. The Knight has moved from being a questing Knight to being accepted as the Queen's Knight. As before, he is seen in different places and assumes different forms in the painting.\n\n'The pair accommodate each other in a courtly way. There are chequer-board lines bent by space and time, some squares are filled in, some are empty, suggesting that a game or a quest is taking place. The whole is oriented towards a central egg form, as if in deference to a primordial parent. When this painting was made, my preoccupations, as I recall them, were mostly in terms of forms and colours. Forms and colours came to the pioneer painter first, words follow, perhaps years later, if at all.\n\n\u2018When this painting was finished, I saw that it did not succeed in expressing all the qualities that I had sought, for example: I felt that the realm of the Dark Queen should be transparent, but the world as painted gave the impression of being solid. I knew, that other ways of expression had to be found. In looking back, it can be seen that aspects of the landscape of the Queen had grown from Cezanne and Cubism, and the Light Knight was a distant relative of de Chirico's manikins. I called this painting \u201cA Present for the Past\u201d, in the hope that it would add lustre to those paintings that had marked my way, and also to give me courage to venture further\u2019.\n\nThere is a photograph of Onslow Ford's studio at Erongar\u00edcuaro in Mexico, where the picture was painted, which shows part of the other version and which confirms that the other picture was very similar but not identical in composition, and much darker in tone.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1978-80: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1981\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1942", "dimensions": "Support: 1013 x 1213 mm", "reference": "T02391", "title": "A Present for the Past", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/onslow-ford-a-present-for-the-past-t02391", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T02/T02391_8.jpg", "artist": "Gordon Onslow-Ford", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1912\u20132003", "artistbio": "\n Gordon Onslow-Ford born 1912Surrealist and abstract painter.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n The subject is taken from an early poem by Tennyson, 'The Ballad of Oriana', published\nin the Moxon edition of his Poems (1857). In the poem, Oriana stands on the wall of a castle, watching her betrothed in a battle below. An arrow meant for the knight strays, killing her instead. Sandys does not attempt to illustrate Tennyson's\npoem, but refers obliquely to one line of the ballad, 'She stood upon the castle wall'. Alfred Lord Tennyson was greatly admired by the Pre-Raphaelites, who were included among the illustrators for the Moxon edition. Sandys became acquainted with the\nPre-Raphaelites in 1857, and was much respected by them although he always remained on the fringes of the group. Holman Hunt made two illustrations to Oriana for the Moxon Tennyson, but they bear no stylistic similarities to Sandys's\npainting.The artist's interest in fifteenth-century Flemish painting, particularly that of Rogier Van der Weyden and Jan Van Eyck, is apparent in the minute observation of the sitter's skin, hair and clothing, and in the detailed background\nlandscape. Sandys toured Belgium and Holland the year after painting Oriana. The bridge with a castle in the background, which suggests a European setting, was actually based on Bishop's Bridge in the artist's native Norwich. The same bridge\nalso figures in Autumn (Norwich Castle Museum) which Sandys was probably working on at the same time as Oriana.The texture of rich fabrics, such as the brocade in the cloak, had a recurring fascination for Sandys. The Clabburn\nfamily, internationally renowned shawl manufacturers, lived in Thorpe, near Norwich, and patronised the artist. Oriana was in the collection of William Houghton Clabburn until his death in 1889. He probably bought the painting when it first\nappeared at the Royal Academy in 1861. Sandys's only other exhibit that year was a portrait of Mrs Clabburn, painted in 1860. He also painted or drew other members of the family.Oriana was lost sight of by scholars for many years, before\nreappearing at auction in 1984. It is one of several paintings by the artist of the late 1850s and early 1860s which show his earliest, most 'hard-edged' Pre-Raphaelite style. From about 1862 Rossetti's influence becomes more apparent in his\nwork.Further reading:The Tate Gallery 1984-86: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1988, pp.80-1, reproducedTerry RiggsJanuary 1998 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on wood", "date": "1861", "dimensions": "Support: 251 x 190 mm", "reference": "T03904", "title": "Oriana", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/sandys-oriana-t03904", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03904_8.jpg", "artist": "Frederick Sandys", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1829\u20131904", "artistbio": "\n Sandys, born Anthony Frederick Augustus Sands at Norwich, studied under his father Anthony Sands, a drawing\nmaster and portrait and subject painter. He was educated at Norwich Grammar School and at the Government School of Design at Norwich. An early patron was the Revd James Bulwer, Rector of Stody and a former pupil of Cotman. Sandys made architectural and\nantiquarian drawings for him and etched his drawings. He exhibited drawings at the Norwich Art Union from 1839 and won Royal Society of Arts medals in 1846 and 1847. By 1851, the year he first exhibited at the Royal Academy, he had moved to London.\nHe married Georgina Creed, the daughter of a Norwich artist, in 1853. He changed the spelling of his name from Sands to Sandys in about 1855. A precocious draughtsman, he worked mainly as an illustrator and portraitist, but in the late 1850s and early\n1860s he also painted in oils (see Oriana, 1861, Tate Gallery T03904). Sandys first became acquainted with the Pre-Raphaelites in 1857, while working on his engraving A Nightmare, a parody of\nMillais's Sir Isumbras at the Ford. He called on Rossetti in order to get an accurate likeness for the engraving, and they became friends. He was thereafter much admired but remained on the fringes of the group. His first independent\nillustration appeared in the Cornhill Magazine in 1860. He visited Holland and Belgium in 1862. For most of 1866 he stayed with Rossetti at 16 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, and went on a walking tour with him in October that year, but they afterwards\nfell out. He began living with Mary Jones (the actress Mary Clive) in the late 1860s; she bore him nine children. Among his later works was a series of chalk portraits of writers commissioned in 1880 by Alexander Macmillan.He showed regularly at the\nRoyal Academy from 1851 to 1886, and at the Grosvenor Gallery, London from 1877. He became a founder member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in 1898.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is a large beige painting of a cropped suburban landscape. Portrait in format, it is dominated by its foreground area of poured paint out of which short lengths of khaki-coloured threads protrude. Green and pink threads have been stitched into the canvas in this area to represent flowers and, perhaps, grass. The upper third of the canvas is occupied by the sketched outline of a building resembling a house and adjoining garage. It is modern in style (1970s) and mainly concealed by a long brick wall, parallel to a long, sloping roof. The opening of the garage, partially outlined by two narrow strips of wood veneer glued onto the canvas, is the main focal point of the painting. Outlines of the roof, chimney, walls and driveway are delineated by lines of bobbly brown wool. Plants growing around the base of the garage are suggested by stitched brown yarns in co-ordinating tones. The building and its driveway, the sky behind it and the piece of open ground in front of it are all the same beige colour, only distinguished from each other by added texture. In the sky, bits of fibre have been incorporated into the washes of paint. On the house, lines of bricks and shadows, resulting from the roof overhang, have been drawn using parallel lines of fine thread stitched through the canvas. In the foreground area the blending and cracking of the paint has created the appearance of a vast muddy pool, dotted with the emerging plant details. Raedecker has been making paintings incorporating thread since 1993. He has explained:\n\n\nWorking with thread is something that\u2019s become my technique. Using it is sometimes quite elaborate ... I think of it like building ... memory from the recollection of influences from the past, in the present, maybe even building the future. I think if I had embroidered the whole image then I would go too far, it would really be too much like craft or folk art ... there are certain details which are important so they deserve more work and more detail. Others are empty. There are things happening on the surface of the overall image which hopefully make your eye float around the image ... I always try to find different means for how to use thread ... I don\u2019t fill everything in. I leave room for the viewer to step into the image. \n\n(Quoted in Die Young Stay Pretty\n[p.42].)\n\n\nRaedecker\u2019s paintings typically depict landscapes and modern interiors, always eerily devoid of humans or animals. His colours are muted and cool in tone \u2013 blues, greens, greys, browns, beige and white. To make a painting, Raedecker alternately suspends the canvas vertically in space, allowing him to pass threads through it with ease, and lays it down flat in order to paint on it. Dilute acrylic is applied in thin washes or, in a thicker state, is poured creating organic pools and blobs. The drying process of the poured acrylic creates unpredictable effects, which the artist enjoys. Stitched threads and scattered fibres matt into layers of the paint and emerge from it. Natural and synthetic yarns and fibres are mixed with such decorative elements as sequins and, occasionally as in this painting, narrow strips of wood veneer of the type used to cover the surface of furniture and panelling. The paintings convey moods ranging from melancholy to the vaguely sinister. Their restrained colours and at times desolate emptiness contrast with the tactility of the materials, resulting in an enigmatic sense of unease. Common to post 1950s suburbia throughout the western world, the architectural features and compromised natural environments in Raedecker\u2019s paintings stem from the artist\u2019s childhood and adolescence. Born and bred in Holland, he has described that country as a \u2018false landscape\u2019 (quoted in Turner Prize 2000, [p.9]). Although buildings in his paintings are accurately delineated according to perspectival rules, the landscape is often viewed from strange angles, creating unreal spaces, the stuff of dreams. The title, overnight,\nwould seem to indicate a sleeping house, the contents of which the viewer may only imagine. The shadows under the house\u2019s eaves indicate moonlight, but no moon or even sky is portrayed. \n\nRaedecker specifies that his titles should be all lower case letters because for him, a title is \u2018just a word\u2019 associated with the image of the painting (quoted from an unpublished conversation with the artist, 16th October 2002), rather than a proper name.\n\nFurther reading:\nDie Young Stay Pretty, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London 1998, pp.7,8 and 42-5\nMichael Raedecker: extract, exhibition catalogue, Stedelijk van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven 1999, reproduced (colour) p.17\nTurner Prize 2000, exhibition brochure, Tate Britain 2000, [pp.8-9]\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nAugust 2002\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint, acrylic paint, wood veneer, wool and cotton thread on canvas", "date": "1998", "dimensions": "Support: 1879 x 1475 x 75 mm", "reference": "T07515", "title": "overnight", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/raedecker-overnight-t07515", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07515_8.jpg", "artist": "Michael Raedecker", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1963", "artistbio": "\n Dutch painter active in England. He first trained as a fashion designer, studying at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Amsterdam (1985\u201390) and the Rijksakademie, Amsterdam (1993\u20134) before retraining as an artist at Goldsmiths College in London (1996\u20137). After serving an apprenticeship with radical designer Martin Margiela, he eventually came to unite his interest in textiles and paintings by making pictures which incorporate embroidery. Many of his large canvases depict pristine Modernist interiors that seem to have become dirty with age, their clean forms and smooth planes upset by the addition of wools and threads that make the places depicted look worn and ragged. Raedecker's landscapes also seem melancholic and slightly comic, like darkened and impoverished versions of old Romantic subjects. Often, as in Phantom (1999; see 1999\u20132000 exh. cat., p. 33), these views are centred on log-cabin retreats suggestive of a hopeless modern dream of returning to nature. In 1998 Raedecker also began a series of Tronies, intricately stitched heads of old men named after the Dutch 17th-century genre (particularly associated with Rembrandt and Jan Lievens), intended as a study of social types and sensibilities.

His father, a fashionable nerve specialist, owned a clinic where many of Blanche's sitters had been patients. As a painter he had both talent and charm, and he enjoyed a great vogue in his day. His work lacks originality and was much influenced by such contemporaries as James Tissot and John Singer Sargent. The loose brushwork and subdued colouring of his portraits are also reminiscent of Edouard Manet and English 18th-century artists, especially Thomas Gainsborough. Except for a few lessons with Henri Gervex and Ferdinand Humbert (1842\u20131934), he had no formal training, and many of his paintings have deteriorated because of poor technique. He worked best on a small scale, and some of his less ambitious oils and small sketches (e.g. Head of a Young Girl, 1885; priv. col., see Post-Impressionism, exh. cat., London, RA, 1979\u201380, p. 46) are among his most appealing works. The few pastels he executed during the 1880s and 1890s are also of high quality, as exemplified by the dramatic portrait of the poet Georges de Porto-Riche (?1890\u201395; London, F.A. Soc.)\nAs much at home in England as in France, Blanche visited London every year from 1884 with great success. His chief patrons there were Mrs Saxton Noble and Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland. Among the many portraits he painted of English sitters are those of Mrs Holland (1885; untraced) and the Saville Clark Sisters (c. 1890; Leeds, C.A.G.), both of which have a panache worthy of Sargent. His ability to capture a sitter's personality is particularly apparent in his portrait of Aubrey Beardsley (1895; London, N.P.G.), for whose novel, Under the Hill, Blanche wrote the preface. He also painted the artist Charles Conder (1904; London, Tate), James Joyce (1934; Dublin, N.G. and 1935; London, N.P.G.), Violet Trefusis (1926; London, N.P.G.) and Virginia Woolf (1927; Providence, RI, Sch. Des., Mus. A.).\nBlanche regularly spent his summers at his family house in Dieppe, playing host to many of his artist friends, including Walter Sickert and Sargent, and popularizing Dieppe as an artistic colony. There he painted his masterpiece, the large group portrait of the Norwegian landscape painter Frits Thaulow and his Family (1907; Paris, Mus. d'Orsay). He made a generous bequest of his own paintings, and those he had collected, to the nearby Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in Rouen.\nBlanche's closest connections, however, were with Paris. He exhibited at the Salon from 1882 to 1889 and at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts from 1890. Although he quarrelled irrevocably with his patron Comte Robert de Montesquiou in 1889, he remained part of the social and cultural life of Paris. Many of his friends were painters\u2014among them Edgar Degas, Paul Helleu and Giovanni Boldini. He painted portraits of the composer Claude Debussy (untraced), the poet Anna de Noailles (1912; Rouen, Mus. B.-A.) and the dancer Vaclav Nijinsky (1910; London, priv. col.), depicted life-size in Diaghilev's production Les Orientales. His portrait of Marcel Proust (1892; Paris, priv. col.), whom he had met in the salon of a fashionable hostess in 1891, depicts the author as a young dandy on the threshold of society. The two became good friends; Proust helped Blanche with his writing and corrected the proofs of his Cahiers d'un artiste, a series of letters about the activities of their mutual friends (under pseudonyms) during World War I. Proust also wrote the preface to Propos de peintre, a group of essays in which Blanche discussed many painters from Jacques-Louis David to his own time. Blanche was unhappy about Proust's remark in his introduction that the artist when young had been known as one whose \u2018sole ambition was to be a much sought-after man of the world'; but this criticism is born out by his own memoirs, which recount his life in society and often compromise accuracy for entertainment.\nBibliographyExposition Jacques Emile Blanche, 1861\u20131942 (exh. cat. by D.

He studied at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin and at the Royal Hibernian Academy (1879\u201383), before attending the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Antwerp (1883\u20134). He returned to Ireland but soon moved to Paris, and he continued to exhibit there until 1908.\nIn his earliest French landscapes O'Conor was influenced by the Impressionists. In such paintings as Still-life with Bottles (1892; London, Tate), an early Brittany painting, he used a technique of separated brushstrokes based on the Neo-Impressionism of Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. O'Conor's preference for rich colour contrasts and thick textures came to the fore in landscapes of Brittany between 1892 and 1895 in which he applied the paint in long, parallel stripes of colour. O'Conor's etchings are rhythmically drawn and boldly expressed linear interpretations of the landscape at Le Pouldu. \nO'Conor's later work in Brittany became more conservative, although a number of pictures of the rocky coastline from 1898 are particularly vigorous and expressionist in feeling. He moved to Paris in 1904, exhibiting for many years at the Salon d'Automne and painting numerous still-life groups, portraits and nudes, often experimenting with different approaches and techniques. Later paintings are more heavily textured, his still-lifes and nudes showing extensive use of the palette-knife. Known to have had a formidable personality, O'Conor was a dominant figure among a group of artists and writers, including Clive Bell and W. Somerset Maugham. Near the end of his life O'Conor married his former model and mistress, Ren\u00e9e Honta.\nBibliographyC. Bell: Old Friends (London, 1956), pp. 163\u20139W.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Although John Dodgson's closest allegiance as an artist was to the Euston Road School, he avoiding categorisation or alliance to any particular artistic faction. His work may bear comparison with the fantastical landscapes of the 1940s painted by artists such as Paul Nash and Edward Wadsworth, but his chief inspiration was historical. He had an unusually good first-hand knowledge of the works of French Post-Impressionist painting and the Italian Quattrocento, which was derived from his extensive travel.\n\nDodgson's technique was idiosyncratic. His paintings began with close observation of a scene, which he would note accurately on the spot. He would then seek out flat patterns, rhythms and textures, and transform the reality he had seen into an image which bears some resemblance to the landscape of a dream. His drawings show his progress from the images observed to the final result, which was the product of his own personal meditation. However, in some cases, for example that of Giant Snail, much of the transformation occurred on the canvas. \n\nDodgson rarely considered his paintings to be finished. He used layers of paint and varnish to build up the image and worked on canvases for many years. As he worked he juggled shapes on the canvas, allowing them to evolve and change. Thus, in this painting, a form, which, most probably, began as the hat of a girl standing in a crowd became the shell of a huge snail, while organic forms appear to grow and take over the nocturnal scene, and architectural features appear to come to life. \n\nGiant Snail is an amalgamation of topographical fact, memories and fantasy. When it was acquired Dodgson explained its development,\n\n\n\nthis originated with a factual drawing of the old Porta San Donato at Lucca, 1951, which thereafter underwent a series of metamorphoses until the present design emerged, &amp; I think I exhibited it at the London Group \u2026 but I have since then repainted it extensively over the intervening years. You are quite right in seeing an echo of Verona in the background \u2026 The picture has really become a fantasy depicting a mediaeval Italian fortress in the ramparts of which the stone lions have now come to life and stand guard in lieu of the one time human sentries. The foreground is a mass of debris across which the Giant Snail is trailing, and a couple of girls on the left approach a shrine &amp; a crowd of boys rush down the hill side on the right (Dodgson quoted in Chamot, Farr and Butlin, p.154).\n\nWhen Giant Snail was first shown in 1959 in a retrospective exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery arranged by Helen Lessore the Times critic commented that the painting 'expresses a vein of undemonstrative poetry given weight by the carefully methodical technique, and a certain sombreness and mystery of colour' (quoted in Pery, p.22).\n\n\n\nFurther reading:Jenny Pery, John Dodgson: Paintings and Drawings, exhibition catalogue, The Fine Art Society, London 1995, reproduced p.23.Mary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, Vol. 1, Tate Gallery 1964, p.153-4.\n\nChloe JohnsonSeptember 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1951\u20139", "dimensions": "Support: 635 x 762 mm", "reference": "T00349", "title": "Giant Snail", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dodgson-giant-snail-t00349", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00349_8.jpg", "artist": "John Dodgson", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1890\u20131969", "artistbio": "\n John DODGSON b. 1890\n\nPainter, influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Symbolist movements, associated through friendship with the Euston Road Group.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nWork No.1103 2011 consists of seven thick horizontal rectangular strokes of dark red-brown oil paint applied across a commercially prepared and unframed canvas. The bands of paint appear as though they are stacked on top of each other, and narrow incrementally in width from bottom to top so as to form a ziggurat shape. The bottom stroke spans the entire width of the canvas. All of the white ground has been left exposed around the painted shape. The colour has been applied from left to right in a single layer of uniform thickness, with a set of flat brushes reducing in breadth from bottom to top (7.5 cm, 6.5 cm, 5.5 cm, 5 cm, 4 cm, 3.5 cm and 3 cm). The artist\u2019s signature and the date (\u2018Martin Creed 2011\u2019) is written in pencil on the reverse bottom edge of the canvas.\n\nWork No.1103 is one of a series of paintings that the artist started making in 2006. Each work consists of one colour of oil paint applied according to the range of sizes available in one standard pack of household brushes. The first painting in this series, Work No.508 (Black Painting) 2006 is composed of a stack of horizontal rectangular bands similar to Work No.1103 except that the sequence of painted strokes reverses so that the thinnest band is at the bottom with the strokes getting thicker towards the top. Another work of 2006, Work No.585, consists of black strokes that are stacked along the left hand margin. Subsequent related paintings include Work No.596 2006, Work No.903, Work No.904, Work No.930, Work No.931, Work No.932, Work No.933, Work No.977 (all 2008), Work No.991 2009 and Work No.1315 2011.\n\nWork No.1103 can also be compared to Creed\u2019s stacked sculptural works including Work No.67 (As many 1\u201d squares as are necessary cut from 1\u201d masking tape and piled up, adhesive sides down, to form a 1\u201d cubic stack) 1992, and to later sculptures such as Work No.396 2005 which consists of piled up planks of wood, and Work No.916 2008 and Work No.998 2009 which consist of stacked boxes and chairs respectively. Creed regularly returns to pre-existing motifs and processes when making new work. The artist has stated: \u2018it has always been kind of like that for me, like going back to things and looking at [my works] again, jumping backwards and forwards.\u2019 (\u2018Martin Creed: Twenty (More) Questions by Corinna Durland\u2019, http://www.martincreed.com/site/words/questions-by-corinna-durland, accessed 11 January 2013.)\nLinks also exist with his first catalogued work, Work No.3 (Yellow Painting) 1986, described by Creed as \u2018a single swirly brushmark made with a big brush on a small canvas. I was trying to simplify things: I wanted to make a painting with just one brushmark, one wave of the arm. I would like to make work that is direct and not thought-out, like a convulsion or a natural event. That painting was a bit like that.\u2019 (Martin Creed Works, 2010, p.1015.)\nJournalist Miranda Sawyer, commenting on the ziggurat paintings, has remarked: \u2018These works are all about restrictions: impersonal rules which require a quick, definitive line in space in order to complete the task ... the mark made must be directly proportional to the ground one. And so on, until there aren\u2019t any paintbrushes left in the packet. Part random, part ordered.\u2019 (Miranda Sawyer, \u2018People Know What\u2019s Fake and What\u2019s Not\u2019, Observer, 18 July 2010, http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/jul/18/martin-creed-interview-miranda-sawyer, accessed 11 January 2013.)\n\nWork No.1103 emblematises a number of central themes and strategies found in much of Creed\u2019s work, such as an economy of means and processes, minimal ordering and incrementation, and a certain playfulness. In this particular case the work demonstrates the artist\u2019s reluctance to make overly conscious choices, specifically about what size of brush to select. He has stated that \u2018I find it difficult to chose, or to judge, or to decide\u2019 (cited in Virginia Button and Charles Esche, Intelligence. New British Art 2000, exhibition catalogue, Tate Britain, London 2000, p.49). Using all of the brushes equally is a way of avoiding having to choose one over another. For psychoanalyst Darian Leader, \u2018These pieces are both testimony and solution to indecision\u2019 (Martin Creed Works, 2010, p.xxxix). Regarding Creed\u2019s paint choice, the critic Michael Archer has linked the artist\u2019s approach to that of an acknowledged influence, the abstract painter Frank Stella (born 1936) who once said that in each of his canvases he was trying to \u2018keep the paint as good as it was in the can\u2019 (cited in Ikon Gallery 2008, p.36). Creed\u2019s work is generally linked to a wide range of art movements from conceptualism, minimalism, situationism, abstraction and the \u2018young British artist\u2019 movement of the 1990s. However, Creed often resists categorising his work according to such a lineage, remarking with an air of naivety, humour that \u2018everything is kind of a little experiment in trying to make enough decisions to be able to come up with something I am happy with\u2019 (Martin Creed Works, 2010, p.x).\n\nWork No.1103 and the three related works also gifted to ARTIST ROOMS (Work No.1102 2011, Tate AR01150; Work No.1104 2011, Tate AR01153; and Work No.1105 2011, Tate AR01154) were donated to the ARTIST ROOMS collection before being publicly exhibited. Collectively they form something of a sequential unit in having four, five, six and seven colour bands respectively. Creed became the first new artist to join the ARTIST ROOMS collection after its formal establishment in 2008 when he donated a complete \u2018room\u2019 of his work in 2012, including this work.\n\nFurther reading\n\nMartin Creed: Works, exhibition catalogue, Southampton City Art Gallery 2000.\nMartin Creed, exhibition catalogue, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham 2008.Martin Creed, Tom Eccles, Massimiliano Gioni and others, Martin Creed Works, London 2010.\nAndrew PatrizioThe University of EdinburghMarch 2013\n\nThe University of Edinburgh is a research partner of ARTIST ROOMS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "2011", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 610 x 457 mm", "reference": "AR01152", "title": "Work No. 1103", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/creed-work-no-1103-ar01152", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/AR/AR01152_8.jpg", "artist": "Martin Creed", "collection": "\n        Tate / ", "artistlife": " born 1968", "artistbio": "\n English sculptor, installation artist and conceptual artist.

During this period Legros had a taste for early Netherlandish art and for French Romanticism, which was later superseded by his admiration for Claude, Poussin and Michelangelo. However, his devotion to Holbein proved constant.\nLegros began etching in 1855; he preferred this medium and produced over 600 plates. Many of his early works are deliberately rough in execution.\nLegros emerged as a leader of the younger generation of realists, notwithstanding his conspicuous dependence on Courbet. However, this critical success brought no financial security, and in 1863 Legros visited London where he found admirers and patrons. Legros resolved to remain in London. \nIn 1876 Edward John Poynter recommended Legros to succeed him as Professor of Fine Art at the Slade School. Legros occupied this position until 1893 and introduced etching and modelling to the syllabus. He was a founder-member of the Society of Painter-Etchers in 1881 and of the Society of Medallists in 1885; the revival of the cast art medal was due almost entirely to his example. \nWith its classically inspired economy of form and design, Legros's interpretation of his realist subject-matter exerted a decisive influence in England on the representation of peasant life in the 1880s. He had a taste for the macabre. In the etchings Death of the Vagabond and Death and the Wood-cutter, these themes coalesce in a stark blend of realism and fantasy which is simultaneously elevated and humane.\nBibliography\n L.

His father was a Chelsea boat-builder who had been J. M. W. Turner's boatman. Greaves and one of his brothers, Henry Greaves (1844\u20131904), met Whistler in 1863, introducing him to the delights of the Thames, becoming his studio assistants, pupils and close friends for over twenty years. Such early works as Hammersmith Bridge on Boat-race Day (c. 1862; London, Tate) and Old Battersea Bridge (c. 1863; priv. col., see 1984 sale cat., no. 2) show Greaves as a master of primitive art, but his later nocturnes, drawings and etchings demonstrate his absorption of Whistler's teachings. Much of his work also provides a fascinating record of 19th-century Chelsea (e.g. Duke Street, Old Chelsea etching, ?1860\u201373; London, BM). During the late 1870s Whistler began to gather a more sophisticated group of friends, including Walter Sickert and Mortimer Menpes. Excluded from this circle, Greaves suffered years of neglect, misfortune and poverty before his discovery by William Marchant, proprietor of the Goupil Galleries, who exhibited Greaves's work in his London Gallery in 1911. Greaves's new-found glory was shortlived, however: three weeks after the exhibition opened, Whistler's self-appointed biographers, Joseph and Elizabeth Pennell, sullied his reputation by claiming that he had plagiarised Whistler's work. Despite the admiration of a few fellow painters Greaves again fell into obscurity and spent his last eight years as a Poor Brother of the Charterhouse.\nBibliographyE. R. Pennell and J.

In 1908 he won a prize in a national art competition. That autumn he entered the Slade School of Fine Art, where he was taught by Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer. He won several prizes and scholarships and fell in love with Dora Carrington.\nAlthough he experimented with a degree of abstraction while interest in Post-Impressionism was at its height, he did so in order to introduce a barbaric and symbolic note into his essentially realist art. His aim was \u2018to paint a picture in which I hope to express all the sorrow of life'. His masterpiece is a savage indictment of war: entitled Merry-go-round (1916; London, Tate), it portrays a mechanistic nightmare in which rows of serried figures spin forever. Its harsh colour and violent mood announce his dissatisfaction with much English Post-Impressionism which he declared an abject imitation of the French example, \u2018too refined for us \u2013 too sweet. We must have something more brutal today.'\nAfter the stridency of Merry-go-round and other war-time paintings, his work became gentler during the 1920s, using subtle colour schemes and more persuasive rhythms. He began to concentrate on still-lifes and nudes. Dogged by tuberculosis, anxious about his work and depressed at his lack of success, he took his own life in 1939.\nBibliographyMark Gertler, 1891\u20131939 (exh. cat. by J.

The great English exponent of Baroque decorative painting, he was the only one to compete successfully with foreigners for the relatively few large-scale decorative commissions available in England during the first quarter of the 18th century. His skill in this field was remarkable, since his training was irregular and his trips abroad came only after he had reached maturity as an artist.\nIn 1689, aged 14, he was apprenticed to Thomas Highmore (1660\u20131720), a distant relative and specialist in non-figural decorative painting, which included trompe l'oeil effects. While working for Highmore in great houses such as Chatsworth, Derbys, in the 1690s, Thornhill was exposed to the work of foreign decorative painters.\nHis first major commission was in 1707 for the newly constructed Royal Naval Hospital (now College), Greenwich. For the next 19 years he worked there intermittently. Although he was thus engaged at Greenwich for most of his career, Thornhill's work there was sporadic, and he often sought other employment. He competed successfully to secure one of his most prestigious commissions: the interior of the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, London. In 1715 he worked at Hampton Court Palace, near London. Although Thornhill specialised in large-scale, illusionistic wall and ceiling paintings, he occasionally worked in other fields. \nThornhill was highly successful and well rewarded in his own day. He became the first English-born artist to be knighted. His last years were spent producing copies of Raphael's cartoons, presumably for the instruction of future students.\nBibliographyColvinW.

He continued looking to the American models of Abstract Expressionism and Post-painterly Abstraction.\nHe reinterpreted Cubist collage on a massive scale, layering shapes of cut-out canvas painted to look like the rusting metal of the industrial vehicles alluded to in the title. Walker increasingly referred to earlier painted images. Red Strand Infanta II (oil on canvas, 1981; British Council) was one of a group of canvases that made direct allusion to Vel\u00e1zquez and that introduced into his work illusions of deep space; from this point on, he favoured oil painting rather than acrylic.\nFollowing a residency in Australia from 1979 to 1980, Walker was appointed Dean of Melbourne's Victoria College of the Arts in 1982.The changes in his painting are likewise reflected in his production as a printmaker, from the larger-scale lithographs such as the Blackboard Print series (1.0\u00d70.7 m, 1973; British Council) to his later preference for the gestural surfaces and physicality of etching, for example Oceania II (0.4\u00d70.4 m, 1984; see 1985 exh. cat., p. 43).\nBibliographyA.

She studied in London at St Martin's School of Art (1975\u20139) and at the Royal College of Art (1980\u201383), where she completed her MFA. Her paintings are densely worked and evoke the landscape. Cardinal (1984; see 1984 exh. cat., p. 9) and Mortal Coil (1984; London, Brit. Council) are sombre depictions of crevices and mountains. Using thick paint and evoking a darkly sensuous mood, the pictures also suggest bodily features and surfaces. Much like the art of Frank Auerbach or Leon Kossof, her work shares with Neo-Expressionism a sense of the mythic and symbolic while escaping the empty rhetoric of that movement; she went on to employ a delicate and virtuoso painting technique that suggests a considered, contemplative practice. Bedrock (1990; see 1991 exh. cat., p. 11) takes the surface texture of rock as the starting point for a visual field that suggests the coalescing of one form into another. Such illusions are the result of her procedure, by which the surface of the painting is gradually covered from one edge to the other. Oulton went on to create complicated palindromic forms as in Trista I (1998; see 2000 exh. cat., p. 5). Her interest in repeated forms was extended in paintings that allude to strips of film negatives: Still and Slow Motion (both 1999; see 2000 exh. cat., pp. 11\u201312) are typical in repeating four delicately rendered forms against a neutral background.BibliographyLandscape, Memory and Desire (exh. cat., essays R.

Alexander the Great, King of Macedon and the founder of a mighty empire, died in Babylon in 323 BC at the age of only thirty-three. His body was taken to Alexandria for burial, and he was accorded divine honours in Egypt and elsewhere. \n\nIn painting this picture, Bauchant seems to have followed very closely the description of the funeral chariot and the accompanying procession given in Charles Rollin's Histoire Ancienne, which according to Maximilien Gauthier (op. cit., p.43) was one of his favourite bedside books. The English translation The Ancient History of Egyptians, Carthaginians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medes and Persians, Grecians and Macedonians\n(London c.1830), Vol.3, pp.530-1, gives this passage as follows: \n\n'As soon as these [the tracks along which the procession was to pass] were levelled, that magnificent chariot, the invention and design of which raised as much admiration as the immense riches that glittered all over it, set out from Babylon. The body of the chariot rested upon two axle-trees, that were inserted into four wheels, made after the Persian manner; the naves and spokes of which were covered with gold, and the felloes plated over with iron. The extremities of the axle-trees were made of gold, representing the muzzles of lions biting a dart. The chariot had four draught beams, or poles, to each of which were harnessed four sets of mules, each set consisting of four of these animals; so that this chariot was drawn by sixty-four mules. The strongest of these creatures, and the largest were chosen on this occasion. They were adorned with crowns of gold, and collars enriched with precious stones and golden bells. \n\n'On this chariot was erected a pavilion of entire gold, twelve feet wide, and eighteen in length, supported by columns of the Ionic order, embellished with the leaves of acanthus. The inside was adorned with a blaze of jewels, disposed in the form of shells. The circumference was beautified with a fringe of golden network; the threads that composed the texture were an inch in thickness, and to those were fastened large bells, whose sound was heard at a great distance. \n\n'The external decorations were disposed into four relievos. \n\n'The first represented Alexander seated in a military chariot, with a splendid sceptre in his hand, and surrounded, on one side, with a troop of Macedonians in arms; and on the other, with an equal number of Persians armed in their manner. \n\n'These were preceded by the king's equerries. \n\n'In the second were seen elephants completely harnessed, with a band of Indians seated on the fore-part of their bodies; and on the hinder, another band of Macedonians, armed as in the day of battle. \n\n'The third exhibited to the view several squadrons of horse ranged in military array. \n\n'The fourth represented ships preparing for a battle. \n\n'At the entrance into the pavilion were golden lions, that seemed to guard the passage. \n\n'The four corners were adorned with statues of gold representing Victories, with trophies of arms in their hands. Under the pavilion was placed a throne of gold of a square form, adorned with the heads of animals, whose necks were encompassed with golden circles a foot and a half in breadth: to these were hung crowns that glittered with the liveliest colours, and such as were carried in procession at the celebration of sacred solemnities. \n\n'At the foot of the throne was placed the coffin of Alexander, formed of beaten gold, and half filled with aromatic spices and perfumes, as well to exhale an agreeable odour, as for the preservation of the corpse. A pall of purple wrought with gold covered the coffin. \n\n'Between this and the throne the arms of that monarch were disposed as he wore them while living. \n\n'The outside of the pavilion was likewise covered with purple flowered with gold. The top ended in a very large crown of the same metal, which seemed to be a composition of olive-branches. The rays of the sun, which darted on this diadem, in conjunction with the motion of the chariot, caused it to emit a kind of rays like those of lightning ... \n\n'The chariot was followed by the royal guards, all in arms, and magnificently arrayed. \n\n'The multitude of spectators of this solemnity is hardly credible; but they were drawn together, as well as by their veneration for the memory of Alexander, as by the magnificence of this funeral pomp, which had never been equalled in the world.' \n\nRobin Lane Fox states that Rollin's source was Diodorus Siculus. Several highly scholarly attempts have been made to reconstruct the appearance of the funeral chariot, but Bauchant's picture seems to have been produced quite independently of any of these. \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.34-5, reproduced p.34 \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1940", "dimensions": "Support: 1140 x 1949 mm", "reference": "T00466", "title": "The Funeral Procession of Alexander the Great", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bauchant-the-funeral-procession-of-alexander-the-great-t00466", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00466_8.jpg", "artist": "Andr\u00e9 Bauchant", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1873\u20131958", "artistbio": "\n Andr\u00e9 Bauchant 1873-1958French painter of still lifes of flowers, landscapes and\nfigure compositions inspired by classical history or mythology; one of the so-called 'modern primitives'.

For short periods in 1902 and 1903 Munnings studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris, where he received little tuition but drew inspiration from the paintings he saw there.

In 1911 he joined the artists' colony at Newlyn, Cornwall, where he shared the common enthusiasm for painting directly from nature.

This is the last of the series of eleven works, nine of which belong to the Tate. A fuller account of the series, details of its circumstances and problems in dating may be found in the catalogue entry of Still Life: Last Eleven (No.3) (Tate T03587).\n\nFor an earlier Tate Gallery catalogue the artist\u2019s widow, Ann Stokes Angus, proposed an order for the eleven paintings in the series.[1] This one - Still Life: Last Eleven (No.11) - was his final work. Though only one, No.10 (Tate T03585), was dated by the artist, No.6 (Tate T03580) and No.11 were both dated by his wife: the former \u20183/11/72\u2019, presumably soon after its completion, the latter \u201815/11 1972\u2019. However, she and Richard Wollheim recalled that No.11 was completed on 13 December, thirty-six hours before Stokes died, and she said that her inscription on its back \u2018was a straight forward mistake for 15/12/72 [though] this probably should be the 14/12/72\u2019. She explained the confusion by the fact she often made the \u2018mistake [of] calling Dec. the 11th month\u2019.[2]\n\n\nThe circumstances of the making of this last painting were especially remarkable. Though most of the series was painted in Stokes\u2019s attic studio, from late November his decreasing physical powers had forced him to work in closer proximity to his wife and the last three or four paintings were executed in her pottery in the basement.[3] David Plante, a friend of the artist and owner of Still Life: Last Eleven (No.1), recalled that by the end of November Stokes \u2018was hardly able to hold the brush\u2019,[4] and Ann Buchanan Crosby has described how she observed Ann Stokes Angus help him:\n\n\n\nShe was crouching beside him, his paint brushes in her hand, his palette was on a table beside his easel ... Adrian would groan and indicate which blob of colour he wished Ann to dab a brush into ... He grasped the brush from her and would aim a sure stroke or perhaps two onto the canvas, then jab the brush back to her.[5]\n\n\nIn fact, Ann Stokes Angus explained that it was only this work - the final painting - with which she helped. She recalled that Stokes \u2018took longer over the last 3 and was unable to start the No.10 for several days. No.11 was very, very difficult\u2019.[6] She added later:\n\n\n\nOn the Last of the \u2018Last 11\u2019 ... he sat in front of the canvas &amp; said \u2018You paint it\u2019. I said \u2018How can I paint your picture\u2019 he repeated \u2018you paint it\u2019 ... As he wouldn\u2019t start I sat close behind him &amp; asked where he wanted it started &amp; what colour, &amp; though he could scarcely communicate with ordinary words he showed me what he wanted ... to my relief he got interested in the brush, took it from me &amp; scrubbed out what I had done but for a bit of background &amp; did the whole picture himself. I think he finished it the next day which must have been Wed ... At the end of the last painting session ... he dropped his brushes deliberately, with a clatter &amp; murmured words to the effect that it was finished. I was quite aware that he meant everything was finished.[7]\n\n\nNevertheless, No.11 is consistent with the rest of the series. In common with all but one of the nine works owned by the Tate, it was painted on a prepared canvas (Lefranc). As in the others, the density of the oil paint varies from very thin washes to isolated areas of impasto, a few of which are unusually thick for Stokes, and there are areas of bare ground. A high thinner content gave the paint a largely matt finish and made runs and dribbles a feature of the technique. The colouring of the paintings is continuous with Stokes\u2019s earlier work, though the lighter palette of a number of them is distinctive. With No.5 and No.9 (Tate T03582, T03586), No.11 is one of the lightest, with flecks of white punctuating its predominantly grey, green and pink composition. It is in good condition, though on acquisition it had a bulge from impact or pressure damage.\n\nChris Stephens\nJuly 1998\n\n\n[1] Tate Gallery Acquisitions 1982-4, London 1986, pp.330-6.\n[2] Ann Stokes Angus, letter to Tate, 2 April 1986, Tate catalogue files.\n\n[3]\nIbid.\n[4] David Plante, letter to Tate, 16 March 1986, Tate catalogue files.\n\n[5] Ann Buchanan Crosby, \u2018Souvenir de Adrian Stokes\u2019, Cahiers du Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019art moderne, no.25, autumn 1988, pp.9-12, trans.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n William Townsend studied at the Slade School of Art from 1926 to 1930, where he was taught by Professor Henry Tonks (1862-1937). In the 1930s he became closely associated with the artists of the Euston Road School, who painted works depicting daily urban life in a closely observed, realistic manner. In 1948, the year in which he painted this picture, he had returned from a brief period of conscription in the Royal Artillery and was back at the Slade, this time as a teacher.\n\nThe painting shows a view of the South Bank of the Thames, which was, at this point, undeveloped. The view, as seen from the Victoria Embankment in the foreground, shows Hungerford and Waterloo bridges on the left and St Paul's Cathedral in the distance. The area depicted was to be the site of the Festival of Britain in 1951, but when this image was painted it was still an area badly damaged by war-time bombing and had fallen into dereliction. The painting evokes an era that has been described as 'a period of drabness, austerity, rationbooks and queueing' (Neve, p.10). The subject of the painting, a group of bystanders gazing out over the river, recalls Seurat's depiction of Bathers and the Ile de la Grand Jatte painted in Paris fifty years before. Furthermore, both images capture a city at a point of social transition. The foreground figures and dusky colours also recall images of figures promenading along the London riverside in the early evening light painted by such artists as Sickert (1860-1942), Monet (1840-1926) and Whistler (1834-1903), who claimed that such light effects revealed the city in its natural state. \n\nTownsend's fascination with the underlying structure of his painting can be seen in his interest in the architectural developments within the city as well as in the strong geometric underpinning to the composition. This interest was to develop in the coming years and can be seen in Townsend's two other paintings in the Tate collection: Hop Alleys (Tate N06148) and Dungeon Ghyll (Tate T00486).\n\nFurther reading:Christopher Neve, William Townsend 1909-1973: Retrospective Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings, exhibition catalogue, Royal West of England Academy, Bristol, 1978.Karyn Elizabeth Allen, Charlotte Townsend-Gault, William Townsend in Alberta, exhibition catalogue, The Nickle Arts Museum, The University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.\n\nChloe JohnsonJune 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1948", "dimensions": "Support: 635 x 762 x 18 mm", "reference": "T07601", "title": "South Bank", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/townsend-south-bank-t07601", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07601_8.jpg", "artist": "William Townsend", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1909\u20131973", "artistbio": "\n William TOWNSEND b. 1909\n\nLandscape painter.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In 1959 Spero, her husband the artist Leon Golub (born 1922) and their small children moved from Chicago to Paris, where they lived and worked for five years. The paintings she made during this period, of which Lovers is one, are known as her Paris Black Paintings because of the particular technique involved in making them. After painting a layer of black over a surface of 'gold oil', she then rubbed out parts of the image with turpentine, redrawing and repainting to create ancient-looking effects. This was in part inspired by the classical and ancient art she and Golub had studied together in their shared studio in Chicago. Many of the paintings in this series depict couples of indeterminate gender which, for Spero, represent 'the opposite of the idealised notion of the androgynous as a spiritually unified entity' (de Zegher, p.14). \n\n For many years I have returned to a double image which has assumed diverse forms - in a series of 'le couple' or 'the lovers' - existentially expressed through the inspiration of Tarot cards. This theme embodies a rapport, a contact of two beings in a ritual or sensual sense \u2026 I would like to believe I am creating images of poetic ritual. (Spero, p.122)\n\nIn this particular version of Lovers a sketchily delineated couple face each other as though in dialogue, their bodies disappearing and fusing into each other via their laps. Their mutual gaze both separates and unites them, as they fuse into each other's bodies as well as the larger painted ground of the canvas. Spero ultimately came to see these paintings as being about the isolation we all experience in love - the necessity for distance and separation within the state of connection with another. The tension between these two elements (figures separated and yet joined) expresses the poignancy of this eternal lovers' conundrum.\n\nSpero recalls that after becoming a mother in Chicago she ceased to be noticed as an artist, but in Paris, where the issue of her status as wife or mother seemed irrelevant, she discovered a more open-minded response to her work. On returning to the USA in 1964, during the period of the Vietnam War, she began to make overtly political work which cried out against both the senseless and obscene violence of war and the fact that historically women's voices have not been heard. She became active in the American women's art movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and joined various women artists' action and discussion groups. Her work from this time on brings female figures from historical and mythological sources into contemporary contexts and has come to be known for its feminist content.\n\nFurther reading:Catherine de Zegher, Nancy Spero, exhibition catalogue, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham 1998, pp.4-5Jo Anna Isaak, Jon Bird, Sylvere Lotringer, Nancy Spero, Nancy Spero, London 1996, pp.9-10, 122, reproduced p.11Nancy Spero, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London 1987, reproduced p.40\n\nElizabeth ManchesterSeptember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1962", "dimensions": "Support: 1635 x 2040 mm", "reference": "T07142", "title": "Lovers", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/spero-lovers-t07142", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07142_8.jpg", "artist": "Nancy Spero", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1926\u20132009", "artistbio": "\n American painter. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1945 to 1949 and in Paris at the Atelier Andr\u00e9 Lhote and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (1949\u201350). \nFrom the late 1950s Spero was consistently concerned with showing how the idea of woman as man's inferior had become inherent in male-dominated Western history. Her early dark oil paintings, such as Lovers (1962\u20135; priv. col.), stress male and female erotic desire as a way of briefly unifying sexual polarities. Yet in these schematic and sensuous scenes, the woman is pictured only in the isolated roles of mother, lover and prostitute. In 1966 her dissatisfaction with the commercial demands of New York galleries led her to stop making easel paintings, and she began to work on paper, portraying the violent abuses of imbalanced power relations between the sexes, and the horrors of the Vietnam War, in her subject-matter. Her almost childlike gouache and ink paper works (e.g. Crematorium Chimney and Victims, 1968; priv. col., see Kuspit, p. 90) interpret the male phallus as a symbol of destruction.\nSpero's use of the printed and typed word in her collages of the 1970s, first appearing in her Codex Artaud series (1971\u20133), more explicitly underlined the patriarchal system's isolation and rejection of those it saw as outsiders. In the 1980s she promoted the possibilities for reordering history and reformulating women's identities through her collages employing the ancient format of the scroll and depicting the human body in pictographic language.\nBibliographyC. de Pasquale: \u2018Dialogues with Nancy Spero', Womanart, vii (1977), pp. 8\u201311D.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Shortly after Dicksee was granted a studentship to enter the Royal Academy Schools, he joined the Langham Sketching Club. One evening the set subject was 'Music'. Encouraged with the sketch he had made Dicksee decided to make a repetition of it in oil. In 1877, when he was only 24 years old, the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy with the new title Harmony. \n\nHarmony is one of the most well known pictures by Dicksee, depicting a young man staring adoringly into the eyes of a girl playing the organ. The model for the woman was Hilda Spencer who was then a student at Queens College, Harley Street where Dicksee taught drawing. She sits in a trance like state, seemingly oblivious to her suitor's rapturous gaze. The painted furniture is reminiscent of the medieval figurative panels then being produced by William Burges (1827-81) and William Morris (1834-96). In addition the stained glass reflects the influence of Pre-Raphaelitism and, in particular, Henry Holiday (1839-1927). Holiday was introduced to the applied arts by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-82) and Burges. In 1863 he began his career as a painter of stained glass, employing Dicksee for some years to make cartoons and research costumes and characters in the British Library.\n\nIn recent years an interest in the formal qualities of Harmony has been overshadowed by a burgeoning interest in the iconography of the painting. Kestner remarks that Dicksee suggests 'an intricate series of harmonies, beginning with that between the dominant man and objectified woman \u2026The youth's contemplation endows him with authority, connoted by the gold band on the fourth finger of his left hand, as the enforcer of the myth of domesticity which constrained women' (Kestner, p.87). Kestner takes Dicksee's later self-confessed admiration for Mussolini as indicating his belief in male empowerment over women. Marsh has also suggested constructions of nineteenth-century patriarchy in Harmony centred around the Madonna stained glass which, she believes, is a motif for the devoted mother and wife. The subject of the painting, Marsh argues, is 'the harmonious qualities of true wifehood' (Marsh, p.74). These readings of Harmony, however, overlook the submissive pose of the male suitor who leans on his elbow, starring in awe, rather than in contempt, at the woman.\n\nThe picture proved immensely popular when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy having been given a central position in the first room by the hanging committee. The critic of the Art Journal remarked: 'Another young painter, who has taken not so much a stride as a spring forward is FRANK DICKSEE'. Voted 'Picture of the Year', Harmony was bought by the Chantrey Bequest for the nation for the large sum of \u00a3367 10s (Dibdin, p.4).\n\nFurther reading:Gail-Nina Anderson and Joanne Wright, Heaven on Earth: The Religion of Beauty in Late Victorian Art, exhibition catalogue, Djanogly Art Gallery, Nottingham 1994, p.74, reproduced in colour, p.67Rimbault Dibdin, Frank Dicksee His Life and Work, London 1905, pp.4-6Joseph A Kestner, 'The Male Gaze in the Art of Frank Dicksee', Annals of Scholarship, volume 7, number 2, 1990, pp.187-8Jan Marsh, Pre-Raphaelite Women, London 1987, p.74\n\nHeather BirchallMay 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1877", "dimensions": "Support: 1575 x 940 mm", "reference": "N01587", "title": "Harmony", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dicksee-harmony-n01587", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N01/N01587_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Frank Dicksee", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1853\u20131928", "artistbio": "\n English painter and illustrator.

He also began to work as an illustrator during the 1870s. During the 1880s he was commissioned by Cassell &amp; Co. to illustrate their editions of Longfellow's Evangeline (1882), Shakespeare's Othello (1890) and Romeo and Juliet (1884).\nDicksee's paintings are executed with textural fluidity and rich orchestrations of colour. They reveal a curious blend of influences, in particular the classicism of Frederic Leighton and the abstracted idealism of G. F. Watts. His predilection for the decorative aspects of painting grew out of his studies with Henry Holiday, a designer of stained glass. He passionately championed the Victorian ideals of High Art and publicly condemned the artistic trends that emerged towards the end of his life. His work covers a wide range of subject-matter and genres, including biblical and allegorical paintings.

The first version of this theme was painted in 1952 and was followed by 'Bull Ia' and 'Bull II', so the present composition is in fact the fourth of the series. \n\nThe artist wrote that the series of 'Bulls' developed from an upright painting of 1920 (a still life with a violin) of which a photograph was viewed horizontally. 'And step by step, thirty years after, my mind occupied with other things and in particular with the possibility of using human figures to create a \"bestiary\", were born the successive deformations. And one day the discovery of a bull on my canvases appeared entirely beyond my control. There followed the development of the theme itself (the Bulls VIII to XIII approximately), and finally a change of sensibility with regard to the theme and a new distribution of the elements of the painting' (letter of 25 June 1958). \n\nThe still life with a violin of 1920 referred to above was in his Purist manner. When he took up the composition again in 1952 the forms at once began to assume an organic character in keeping with his change of style, so that, for instance, the shadow of the violin was made to suggest the profile of a head. In the drawings and paintings which followed, the forms underwent a strange metamorphosis as though they had taken on a life of their own. The only traces of the violin which survive in the present composition are the profile-like lines on the left, which are developed from its silhouette, and the curved lines lower down, in the centre, which seem to be derived from the instrument's neck. In the Bull paintings I-X the basic image is that of a three-quarter length figure of a woman with her head turned upwards and fused in some way with the horns of a bull. (This can be seen most clearly in Bulls VI and VII of 1954 and also in some of the early studies). In the Tate Gallery picture, the figure is not so easy to make out. However one can recognise her head with the two eyes and the bull's horns, the torso with its pair of breasts (circular patches of green and red), and the skirt. A new development begins with 'Bull X', of 1955, also known as 'The Rape of Europa', in which the bull's face is introduced in the bottom right-hand corner: the girl appears to be riding on the animal's back. This marks the end of the first part of the series and leads on to the next phase. In the remaining works XI-XV (executed in 1955-7) the upright format is abandoned in favour of a landscape shape, while the bull's face is fused with the figure of a girl in a variety of arrangements. \n\n(The artist kindly allowed the compiler to consult all the material relating to this series.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n From 1950 to 1957 the head was a major theme in William Turnbull's paintings and sculptures. In both disciplines he explored the limits of the motif, often abstracting it up to the edge of its legibility as a head. He later divulged that during the mid 1950s the word itself had 'meant for me what I imagined the word \"Landscape\" had meant for some painters - a format that could carry different loadings.' ('Head Semantics', Uppercase, unpaginated). He continued, 'The sort of thing that interested me was - how little will suggest a head, how much load will the shape take and still read head, head as colony, head as landscape, head as mask, head as ideogram, head as sign, etc'. Referring specifically to the paintings, he said that he had not wanted 'to transpose the head from three dimensional reality to a flat surface - but to imagine what a head would be if flat (squeezed between two pieces of glass like a micro-slide) and made of paint marks'. \n\nLike many artists in the mid 1950s, Turnbull greatly prized the element of chance, remarking 'I prefer the hazards and chance remarks of conversation. The peripheral glance, the observation from the corner of my eye is what interests me.' Within his own paintings he sought to incorporate chance by working directly onto the canvas without making any preparatory sketches. The figure in Head is created from small panes of colour applied in a seemingly random manner; a technique reminiscent of Nicolas de Stael's (1914-55) abstracted figures made up of dabs of thick paint or p\u00e2tes. Mathiessen's Gallery in London had held de Stael's first solo exhibition in Britain in 1952 and during the summer of 1956 the Whitechapel Art Gallery held a retrospective of his work. The critic Lawrence Alloway (1926-90), in a series of articles published in Art News and Review, traced the genealogy of this form of abstracted figuration to the Ecole de Paris of the 1940s. Given the textural surface of Head and the indeterminate nature of the image, Alloway's description of Jean Dubuffet's (1901-85) and Henri Michaux's (1899-1984) work is apposite: 'Henri Michaux whose materials are watercolour and ink, often used on wet paper to introduce unpredictable thickenings and dissolutions of line. The crust of paint in a Dubuffet, from which figures emerge as though tarred and feathered by the medium, corresponds to Michaux's delicate washes and lines from which images emerge conditioned by the physical characteristics of the medium. The images may seem only a little different from random marks and stains but it is in this little distance that his art, and that of many post-war artists, happens.' (Lawrence Alloway 'Background to Action: 3. Paris in the 1940s', Art News and Review, vol. IX, 9 November 1957, p.1). Turnbull had lived in Paris from 1948-50 and was familiar with the work of both artists.\n\nFragmented heads appeared in the work of several British artists in the early and mid 1950s, including that of Turnbull's friends Eduardo Paolozzi (b.1924) and Nigel Henderson (1917-85). For these artists such work as Jean Fautrier's (1897-1964) Otages series, which was first exhibited in Paris in 1945, may have provided a European precedent, but equally their invention may have been inspired by imagination or a wide range of other sources outside the canon of high art.\n\nIn January 1956 Modern Art in the United States opened at the Tate Gallery. The room displaying Abstract Expressionism had an enormous impact on the work of many British artists, but for Turnbull the full importance of this strand of contemporary American art only became apparent after a short trip to New York early in 1957. Thereafter, the head motif disappeared from his paintings as he developed a purely abstract style.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1956 Turnbull sold no work and was living in poverty. During this period he was forced to destroy many sculptures and paintings to make a working space in his small London studio. Head is one of the relatively few paintings that survive from those years.\n\nFurther reading:William Turnbull, 'Head Semantics', Uppercase, 4, 1960, unpaginatedRichard Morphet, William Turnbull: Sculpture and Painting, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1973, pp.31-3William Turnbull: Sculpture and Painting, exhibition catalogue, Serpentine Gallery, London 1995\n\nToby TrevesJune 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1956", "dimensions": "Support: 1270 x 1016 mm", "reference": "T05800", "title": "Head", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turnbull-head-t05800", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05800_8.jpg", "artist": "William Turnbull", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1922\u20132012", "artistbio": "\n Scottish sculptor, painter and printmaker. In the early 1950s Turnbull was involved with the Independent group at the ICA, whose lectures on recent scientific, sociological and philosophical ideas interested Turnbull.\nTurnbull's early work used simple linear elements as basic signs, often implying play and movement. These were followed by paintings in which the motion of groups of figures was suggested by gestural line. The motif of the head as an object became predominant in the mid 1950s. Paintings from the period 1955 to 1957 treated the same motif with a calligraphic handling or heavy use of the palette-knife. Until 1963 his sculpture incorporated several parts in contrasting traditional materials, such as bronze, stone and wood. \nHe began to expunge vestigial imagery. At first he relied on almost monochromatic, heavily worked surfaces, followed by thinly painted colour fields. These were either vertically bisected or incorporated cropped discs that implied an extension beyond the canvas. Later paintings comprised quantities of colour accented by occasional diagonals or bands clinging to the edge. \nTurnbull's painted steel sculptures from 1963 to 1968 often involved irregular zigzag or wavy forms. Turnbull's three-dimensional work corresponded with the concerns of the American Minimalists in its repetition or permutation of ready-made geometric units and concern for different responses to identical forms when set in a new context. Turnbull returned c. 1977 to small, modelled sculptures. These later works, while evoking his sculpture of the 1950s, were more intimate and less dauntingly imposing.\nBibliographyWilliam Turnbull: Sculpture and Painting (exh. cat., intro. R.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Poured Painting: Blue, Black, Blue is a triptych consisting of nearly identical panels. The outline of a black arch on a predominantly blue ground is repeated on each panel. The painting is the product of a meticulous procedure of pouring and tipping that Davenport began employing in 1996, although his technique of pouring paint directly on to canvas or board dates from early in his career. Each panel of Poured Painting, made of medium density fibreboard, was sanded smooth. Davenport sprayed the board all over with household liquid gloss paint in the base colour, in this case a deep blue. Then, working on the floor, he poured black paint directly on to the panel. This process was carefully controlled: the artist stood on an improvised bridge across the painting, pouring paint directly from the paint pot onto the surface of the board. The paint spread across the panel in an ever-increasing circle. Just before it reached the edge of the board, the artist tipped the painting upright, allowing the excess paint to run off the bottom of the panel. This created an arch shape. After leaving this layer of paint to dry, Davenport then repeated the process with the base colour. Again, he stood over the panel, pouring blue paint on top of black until the previous layer was almost completely covered. At this point the panel was positioned upright again. This carefully controlled process was repeated three times to produce the panels of the triptych.\n\nThe panels are positioned so that they abut, creating the impression of a thin, seamless line moving across the surface. The arches appear identical at first glance, but closer inspection reveals differences in the width of the arcs. The machine-like perfection of the forms is contradicted by the evidence of their making. Davenport has commented, \u2018you read the surface as pretty immaculate but on closer inspection you find all the smudges and finger marks around the edge and little bits of grit and bugs\u2019 (quoted in David Batchelor, \u2018Homage to Homer: Ian Davenport in conversation with David Batchelor\u2019, Ian Davenport: New Paintings, p.9). Davenport\u2019s work, while mimicking the language of industrial production, is resolutely handmade.\n\nThe painting has a highly reflective, smooth surface. Davenport has stressed the importance of this sheen, saying, \u2018In order for the paintings to work, because they\u2019re not about any sort of narrative, they need their tactile and reflective quality. This becomes the engagement for the viewer, they become reflected and literally see themselves in the painting.\u2019 (quoted in Michael Bracewell, \u2018A Conversation with Ian Davenport\u2019, Ian Davenport: Large Scale Paintings, p.13)\n\nDavenport has resisted interpretations of his work, preferring to let his paintings provide a purely visual experience. Works like Poured Painting demonstrate the materiality of Davenport\u2019s chosen medium. The process of making is reflected in the painting\u2019s structure which demonstrates the paint\u2019s fluidity and movement, its susceptibility to gravity. In this regard, his technique recalls the work of Jackson Pollock (1912-56), who dripped paint onto canvases positioned on the floor, and Morris Louis (1912-62) who poured paint directly onto unprimed canvases.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\nJonathan Watkins, Ian Davenport: Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Dundee Contemporary Arts, 1999.\nMichael Bracewell, Ian Davenport: Large Scale Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Waddington Galleries, London, 2000, reproduced pp.4-5, 23 in colour.\n\nDavid Batchelor, Ian Davenport: New Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Waddington Galleries, London, 2003.\n\n\nRachel Taylor\nOctober 2003\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "3 works on board, household paint", "date": "1999", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 2438 x 5486 mm", "reference": "T07837", "title": "Poured Painting: Blue, Black, Blue", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/davenport-poured-painting-blue-black-blue-t07837", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07837_8.jpg", "artist": "Ian Davenport", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1966", "artistbio": "\n English painter.

He exhibited in an influential exhibition, Freeze, curated by fellow student Damien Hirst in 1988, and in 1991 he was nominated for the Turner Prize. In 1999 he was a prizewinner in the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition. His abstract paintings are made by pouring layers of household paints on to prepared canvases and boards tilted so that gravity and the consistency of the paint determine the final configuration of the areas of colour. His systematic approach, predetermining both materials and process, results in paintings whose effect is based on physical immediacy rather than any theoretical or narrative background, although the procedures of American painters of the 1950s and 60s associated with Post-painterly Abstraction, notably Morris Louis, have been cited as antecedents. His typical paintings of the early 1990s, such as Untitled (Drab) (1990; London, Tate) were reliant on a technique of pouring gloss paint that resulted in shiny, essentially monochromatic striped surfaces. His work became increasingly colourful through the 1990s yet retained the cool aesthetic dominant in that decade. He introduced a diptych and triptych format and a method of pouring that created a basic arch motif. These multi-panelled works consist of identical images arrived at through a tightly repeated procedure, for instance in the triptych Poured Painting: Magenta, Orange, Magenta (household paint on medium density fibreboard, 2.44\u00d74.57 m, 1999; London, Waddington Gals, see 2000 exh. cat.).\nBibliographyIan Davenport (exh. cat., essay N.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Born Again is a large painting depicting a group of deformed figures in an olive green landscape. The image is dominated by a light green, swirling flash across the diagonal centre of the painting, which creates a sense of energetic movement. In the lower left hand corner, the largest figure is made up of green colours as well as the more fleshy colour of most of the other figures. It is surrounded by areas of green which connect it (visually and literally) to the central light green flash. Diagonally opposite, on the other side of the green flash, another figure appears to be emerging from the light green area. A neck and torso, arched violently backwards, and a leg seem to be pulling themselves out of greyish brown, mouth-like nodes. Behind this figure, smaller figures seem to be popping out of the ground. One of them is joined by another energetic curving and zig-zagging pale green line to a similar-coloured body, which hovers over the horizon in an explosive pale blue field. Essenhigh has written that the painting is\n\nset in the bland heartland of America. At the top is a light that is both an alien spaceship and an angel that is like a sunrise. The light creates a chain reaction or chemical reaction (such as photosynthesis), that causes the people in the painting to be born again. I think of the figure in the lower left as being underground. He is a seed or an embryo which under the proper conditions will be born again \u2026 this painting is by no means a purely ironic view of Christianity. I hope to convey a sense that I too could be a part of a group experience, something which could take me out of my head.(Faxed communication from artist, June 2000).\n\nEssenhigh's figures evoke such terms as humanoid, cyborg, hybrid and mutant. They combine human elements with strange, garment-like body parts and mechanistic, prosthetic extensions. Amputated or fragmented and reconstituted, Essenhigh's figures and forms suggest both technological intervention and the kind of deformation through melting characteristic of the paintings of Surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed (1904-89). Her use of flat colour and fine, mostly dark outlines around her figures emphasises their cartoon-like quality. Essenhigh paints onto a very smooth surface produced by sanding layers of primer already applied to the canvas. She uses rapid-drying, enamel-based oil paint to create first large areas of monochromatic colour, which constitute the background, and then groups of finely delineated figures. Drawing is the basis for all her images. She refers to her paintings as 'giant drawings' (quoted in Dreishpoon, p.3). The paint surface is highly glossy and Essenhigh's colours are often the synthetic tones of interior decorating. These technical facts contribute to making Essenhigh's organic, morphing forms feel inorganic and synthetically produced. She has called her scenarios 'a look back to the future' (quoted in Hoptman, p.75), reinforcing their science-fiction connotations. Man (or woman) merging with machine has been depicted in art since the early twentieth century, becoming increasingly bleak as a vision after the mass-destruction, by machines, of the World Wars. Essenhigh's paintings produced at the end of the 1990s, bearing such titles as Large Fire 1998, Ozone Hole 1998, Explosion 1999 (all private collections) and Deluge 1998 (Albright Knox Gallery, Buffalo), like Born Again, have a millenial twist. Set in her typically bland environments, they revive the eighteenth-century theme of apocalyptic natural disasters in a contemporary world of plastic, prosthetics and cartoons.\n\nFurther reading:Douglas Dreishpoon, American Landscapes: Recent Paintings by Inka Essenhigh, exhibition catalogue, Albright Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo 1999Laura Hoptman, 'Nothing Natural', Frieze, no.47, pp.74-5Hybrids: International Contemporary Painting, exhibition catalogue, Tate Liverpool 2001, pp.22-5, reproduced (colour) p.23\n\nElizabeth ManchesterApril 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Alkyd paint on canvas", "date": "1999\u20132000", "dimensions": "Support: 2292 x 1993 x 49 mm", "reference": "T07702", "title": "Born Again", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/essenhigh-born-again-t07702", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07702_8.jpg", "artist": "Inka Essenhigh", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1969", "artistbio": "\n American painter. She graduated with an MFA from the School of Visual Arts, New York, in 1993. Her Girls' Wallpaper and Boys' Wallpaper (both 1996; see 1999 exh. cat., figs 5 and 6) marked the beginning of her distinctively graphic style of painting, with the repetition of dancers writhing and soldiers on manoeuvres representing female and male attributes respectively. The figures in her paintings are presented floating in front of a monochrome background, with a strong palette of colours and dense materiality of the surface enhancing the graphic, decorative style. A series of paintings made in 1997\u20138 feature these strange amputated figures in scenes of natural or cosmic disaster, as in Deluge (1998; Buffalo, NY, Albright-Knox A. Gal.). Here the characters tumble down a sheet of water, with the depiction more like a cartoon than a harrowing depiction of chaos. The disturbing element in Essenhigh's paintings arises from the mutation of her figures so that they seem part of the landscapes, their lack of heads or expressions connoting an absence of consciousness or individuality. The vivid colours give the paintings an atmosphere of hyperreality, with a clear narrative frustrated by the stylization of the composition. In an interview published in March 1999, Essenhigh described her paintings as being \u2018about America: fake, fun, pop, violent, but also quite attractive'.\nBibliographyG. T.

He studied drawing in Plymouth. In 1824 he moved to London and entered the Royal Academy Schools. Through John Giles, Samuel Palmer's cousin, Calvert met William Blake and the Shoreham circle of the Ancients. He visited Shoreham and, supported by private means, escaped from his Academy studies to pursue his interest in wood-engraving. Rich in Arcadian imagery and chiaroscuro, Calvert's 11 miniature prints, produced between 1827 and 1831, are masterpieces of the medium and are among the most intense expressions of the Ancients' artistic sensibility. Like Palmer, he was inspired by Blake's illustrations to Thornton's edition of Virgil, but the figural content of Calvert's prints is more akin to his friend and fellow student George Richmond's interpretation of Blake than to Palmer's. Unlike the other Shoreham artists, Calvert did not base his pastoral visions on religious poetry such as that of Milton or Bunyan, but found inspiration in Theocritus and other pagan idylls. Early states of his prints frequently incorporated Christian sentences apparently less out of conviction than a desire to refute charges of paganism, since he removed them from later states.\nCalvert's pastoral vision faded but his interest in ancient Greece developed into a more classical sentiment. He abandoned printmaking and for the rest of his life painted mainly for pleasure, working in oil, watercolour and gouache. He took his subjects chiefly from pagan mythology and he visited Greece where he sketched prolifically. In later years Calvert became a recluse with a suitably picturesque appearance.\nBibliographyS.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n After studying at the Slade in 1919, Leon Underwood embarked on a prolific career as a sculptor, painter and print maker, producing an eclectic body of work. In 1930 Underwood produced ten paintings which he described as metaphysical works, of which Casement to Infinity is one.\n\nThe painting was made at Underwood\u2019s home and studio in Girdlers Road, Hammersmith, London, from where he ran the Brook Green School of Art (1920-39), counting Henry Moore (1898-1986) and Eileen Agar (1899-1991) among others as his students. Upon his return from New York and Mexico in late 1928, Underwood began a flurry of artistic meetings and exhibitions, beginning with joining the Neo-Society in 1930. Casement to Infinity was one of six metaphysical paintings exhibited by Underwood in the group\u2019s first and only exhibition.\n\nCasement to Infinity could be described as a modern variation of the traditional Vanitas still life which explores the theme of eternal and spiritual renewal through a series of complex symbols. The still life is set in an Arcadian landscape that evokes the passing of a golden era, signified above all by the classical temple in the distance, but also in the vines whose roots envelop the side of the cliff and encroach the still life itself. The notion of decay is reiterated in the shattered glass of the broken window which opens on to the seascape.\n\nThe arrangement of objects is situated on a ledge, which at second glance appears to be a sun dial upon which a spider spins a web - a further indication of the passing of time. The objects themselves suggest a life and a spiritual cycle: the shell a symbol of earlier forms of life, the evolution of the mammal indicated by the egg which also signifies birth, and finally the human skull, the universal symbol of death, upon which is a butterfly that can connote transience but also resurrection and the soul. There are two other objects on the dial, a pipe whose placement maybe random or have a personal meaning, and a single wing, which may be a reference to the Greek god Hermes the messenger who wore wings on his head and ankles.\n\nThe still life gives onto a sea and skyscape in the distance which are also imbued with symbolism, but in this case of an alchemic and hermetic nature. At the top of the cloud is a star which denotes the all seeing eye of god, which has special significance for Freemasons. There are two triangles, the triangle of perfection which faces upwards and symbolises spiritual perfection and secondly, the triangle facing down which signifies the temporal and physical. The point at which the triangles meet is the horizon, which contrasts temporality with infinite time and space, as implied in the title.\n\nThe manner in which Underwood painted the metaphysical works may be described as Surrealist in their hyper-real rendering. The painting is also overt in its reference to Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978), whose metaphysical paintings often incorporated still life arrangements of unrelated objects set in dramatic perspective, and used a limited and sombre colour palette. A further source of inspiration is likely to have been Edward Wadsworth\u2019s (1889-1949) marine still lifes such as Still Life\n1926 (Tate N05147), which features shells, a distant view of the sea and sharp separation of foreground and background.\n\nFurther reading:\nChristopher Neve, Leon Underwood, London 1974, p.131, 132, reproduced pl.94\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1930", "dimensions": "Support: 762 x 635 mm", "reference": "T02323", "title": "Casement to Infinity", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/underwood-casement-to-infinity-t02323", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T02/T02323_8.jpg", "artist": "Leon Underwood", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1890\u20131975", "artistbio": "\n Leon UNDERWOOD b. 1890\n\nSculptor, wood engraver, painter and writer.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n \nThe painting was executed on a single piece of medium-weight, plain-weave cotton duck canvas that was stretched over an expandable nine-membered softwood stretcher and attached with wire staples at the rear. The artist then applied a thinned coat of a red acrylic emulsion paint (diluted with water) directly to the canvas as a priming layer. This extends over the stretched face and all four edges and the canvas weave texture remains very apparent through it.\n\n\n\nThe paint is all acrylic emulsion and was applied in a variety of consistencies and techniques. Dribbles extend around all four edges, which indicate that much of the paint application was executed with the canvas lying horizontal. Although much of the paint is vigorously brush-marked, the artist is also known to have used squeegees and sponges to apply paint to other works from the same period and it seems likely that other such implements were also used here. The paint exhibits a number of 'drying defects' as a result of this vigorous paint application, especially in the thicker areas of paint. Perhaps the most noticeable of these are the bubbles and craters that are seen in many areas. Although these are now stable and will not enlarge any further, they are viewed as disfiguring by the artist. The paint surface is typically dry and matt, although in areas where much layering has occurred, there is a slight increase in gloss. In many areas the red colour that is visible is simply the thinned layer applied as a primer, although there are several instances of considerable build-up in the paint thickness. The painting is not varnished or framed.\n\n\n\nThe painting is currently in excellent condition, although its surface is particularly vulnerable to being marked by finger prints or scuffs etc. In addition to correct handling and storage, it is therefore essential that it be displayed behind a barrier to keep it in this near pristine condition.\n\n\n\nTom Learner and Peter Booth\nAugust 2000\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1995", "dimensions": "Support: 2140 x 3056 x 52 mm", "reference": "T07052", "title": "St Germain", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/irvin-st-germain-t07052", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07052_8.jpg", "artist": "Albert Irvin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1922", "artistbio": "\n English painter. As a student he painted in an Impressionist style, but during the 1950s, influenced by Walter Richard Sickert, Jack Smith and Edward Middleditch (b 1923), he moved towards the realist style of the Kitchen Sink painters. Woman with Gas Poker (1951; see Moorhouse, 1998, p. 37) is typical: an expressive style captures a domestic scene with muddy, garish colours and a suggestion of ugly brutality. The work of the Abstract Expressionists had an enormous influence on Irvin. Initially he retained his figurative content, but he painted his first fully abstract canvas in 1959. Increasing the scale and moving away from naturalistic colour, he conceived the picture space metaphorically as a terrain with affinities both to London street maps and to landscape. In the late 1960s he became more concerned with conveying the process of painting as a theme in its own right. Across (1974; Aberdeen, A.G.) is typical of this period and of his adoption in that year of the more fluid quick-drying medium of acrylic paint. The expressive diagonal motif, which later would assume great importance in his art, appears at the top of the canvas as plumes of bright yellow and red clouds reaching down to a yellow ground of gestural strokes. In the late 1970s Irvin developed an interest in greater spatial complexity. His subsequent work has the appearance of being built up as a tapestry of gestural strokes, symbols and cross-hatching in lively, chromatically intense compositions.\nBibliographyAlbert Irvin: Paintings 1960\u20131989 (exh. cat., essay P.

The picture depicts three members of the family as allegorical figures dressed in classical style and supported by symbols alluding to their personifications. In the centre is Broome Witts as 'Fortitude'. His strength is indicated by the classical column against which he stands, his wisdom by the figure of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, atop the column. He is introducing 'Hope', in the person of his younger sister Sarah Witts (1745-91), on his right, as a companion to his grieving widow Elizabeth Witts (n\u00e9e London, 1738-1837) as 'Distress', on his left. 'Distress' sits on a towering rock with a snake at her feet, while 'Hope', resting on an anchor, stands against the horizon and open sky, pointing heavenwards. The pervading mood is one of melancholy. \n\nThe picture, successfully emulating the grand manner of portraiture of Sir Joshua Reynolds, was one of Cosway's first submissions to the newly founded Royal Academy, where it was exhibited in 1770. Cosway was elected an Associate of the Academy the same year, an event which must have been assisted by the favourable response to this work. \n\nFurther reading:Stephen Lloyd, Richard &amp; Maria Cosway: Regency Artists of Taste and Fashion, exhibition catalogue, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh 1995, pp.31-2 \n\nTerry RiggsOctober 1997 \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1775", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 1180 x 1040 mm", "reference": "T06969", "title": "Portrait of a Gentleman, his Wife and Sister, in the Character of Fortitude introducing Hope as the Companion to Distress (\u2018The Witts Family Group\u2019)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/cosway-portrait-of-a-gentleman-his-wife-and-sister-in-the-character-of-fortitude-t06969", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06969_8.jpg", "artist": "Richard Cosway", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1742\u20131821", "artistbio": "\n Although remembered primarily as a miniaturist, Cosway also painted oil portraits and, occasionally,\nsubject pictures. Christened at the parish church of Oakford, near Tiverton in Devon, he was a child prodigy. He came to London in 1754, where he studied for a few months with Hudson and then at Shipley's Drawing School, winning a series of prizes for\ndrawing from the Society of Arts between 1755 and 1760. He exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1760 and from 1767 to 1769, then at the Free Society of Artists from 1761 to 1766. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1769, becoming an Associate in\n1770 and a Royal Academician in 1771. He exhibited at the Academy from 1770 to 1806. He became increasingly successful and fashionable as a painter of miniatures during the 1760s. His most notable portrait miniature of this period was that of Miss\nElliot in the Character of Pallas (Fondazione Cosway, Lodi), which was exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1769. Cosway was a diminuitive, flamboyant figure with a reputation for arrogance and womanising. He was often the subject of\ncaricature, but his self-confidence and wit were such that he was able to deflect the derision he received from his artistic peers. A description of an Academicians' meeting in the early 1770s says that Cosway 'attended in all the gay costume of the\ndrawing-room, with pink heels to his shoes, &amp;c., but the room was so full he could not find a place. \"What\", said Frank Hayman, \"can nobody make room for the little monkey?\"'(George C. Williamson, Richard Cosway R.A., London 1897, p.31,\nrevised edition 1905, p.38). In 1781 he married the Anglo-Florentine artist Maria Hadfield (1759-1838). They lived first at 4 Berkeley Street and then at Schomberg House in Pall Mall, where they entertained lavishly and became the epitome of the\nsmart London set. Their high social profile and self-promotion led to targeting by satirists. From 1785 Cosway often signed his works Primarius Pictor Serenissimi Walliae Principis ('Principal painter of his most serene Prince of Wales'),\nand frequented royal circles. He produced several notable life-sized portraits of the Courtenay family at Powderham Castle, including William, 3rd Viscount Courtenay (1791, Coll. Lord Courtenay). In addition, Cosway was an important collector\nof old master paintings, drawings and prints, sculpture and objets d'art.

He studied at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1929 to 1931. During World War II he served with the commandos (1940\u201342), was captured during the raid on Dieppe and spent three years as a prisoner of war. \nFrom 1950 to 1952 Hilton turned from his early figurative painting to a form of abstraction. Around 1956 Hilton began to be compared with the Abstract Expressionists. \nIn many of the paintings from this period Hilton's initial inspiration was derived from the rhythms and colours of the natural world. This has generally been interpreted as a mark of his association with the St Ives artists. \nBy the late 1950s Hilton was speaking of his wish to \u2018reinvent figuration'. The imagery that had consistently featured in his drawing-books emerged sporadically in his works of the 1960s, and finally in the works on paper that Hilton began to produce in 1970, when he was bedridden with a muscular disease.\nHilton returned to the childlike subjects that had characterised his early work: animals, boats, a horse and cart and nudes. Dreams of sensual (often sexual) pleasure co-exist with worries concerning impotence, ill-health and approaching death. Images of stasis and spiritual voyaging abound. Memory, observation and the simple joy of making marks constitute a complex variety of impulses behind these late works, in which Hilton retrieved a childlike freshness of vision, but one marked by a lifetime's experience.\nBibliographyRoger Hilton: Paintings and Drawings, 1931\u20131973 (exh. cat. by N.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In 1957, one year before Spencelayh's death at the age of ninety three, the critic of The Manchester Guardian remarked of his paintings, 'Most of them depict old codgers - the obsolete slang rises unbidden - in junk-crammed interiors that will be of considerable interest to the social historian of the future' (quoted in Noakes, p.53). Spencelayh travelled from his home in Rochester to the South Kensington School (later renamed the Royal College of Art) each day throughout his training as an artist. He continued his studies in Paris before returning to England, first exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1892. For the next sixty-six years, Spencelayh regularly sent canvases to the Royal Academy exhibitions.\n\nListening In depicts an old man listening attentively to a startlingly modern wireless through a pair of head phones. His posture is rigid with amazement as he listens. The domestic interior dense with paintings and ornaments is characteristic of the artist. His son Vernon recounted: 'in his studio he would build on frames the room, sometimes even wall-papers, and hang the walls with what one could expect in a cottage of that date. He had rooms full of such junk' (quoted in Noakes, p.29). These items frequently reappear in Spencelayh's paintings and, according to Noakes, there were frequent enquiries about where various objects depicted could be purchased (Noakes, p.32). Spencelayh's early training as a miniature painter is evident from the highly detailed technique of the painting. Spencelayh's meticulous observation was noted by his contemporaries who described him as 'the Human Camera' (quoted in Noakes, p.37).\n\nSpencelayh began his career in an age when meticulously painted narrative subjects were popular both among artists and the exhibition going public. The movement towards Impressionism at the end of the nineteenth century went unnoticed by Spencelayh who continued to paint genre subjects on a small scale throughout his career. He continued, however, to be supported by several influential collectors and patrons, including the wealthy Mancunian cotton merchant, Mr Levy, and Queen Mary. His paintings, dense with old-fashioned bric-a-br\u00e0c and comments about suburban society, have frequently been described as Dickensian. Both Spencelayh and Dickens were born in Rochester, frequently returning to the cathedral city throughout their careers. In his obituary in The Times the critic remarked 'His work was full of the spirit, of The Old Curiosity Shop in particular \u2026 he had a natural sympathy for the kind of man who keeps one - an old bachelor in his conception'. \n\nFurther reading:Noakes, Aubrey, Charles Spencelayh and his Paintings, London 1978\n\nHeather Birchall June 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on wood", "date": "Exhibited 1933", "dimensions": "Support: 178 x 230 x 14 mm", "reference": "T07729", "title": "Listening In", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/spencelayh-listening-in-t07729", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07729_8.jpg", "artist": "Charles Spencelayh", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1865\u20131958", "artistbio": "\n Charles SPENCELAYH 1865\u20131958\n\nGenre painter, mainly of interiors, miniaturist and etcher.

In the present work the wall on the left whose top is covered with ivy is the wall of his property. The gateway is that of a house with a garden adjoining his own, which he subsequently purchased, but which belongs to the family no longer. The house in the background, with lighted windows, is occupied by other people of the village. The painting can therefore be dated between 1900 and the time of Le Sidaner's London exhibition. Louis Le Sidaner states (letters of 10 and 27 November 1953) that his father often changed the titles of his pictures, rendering it difficult to identify the works mentioned in his papers, but that this is almost certainly 'The Gateway by Moonlight' painted in November and December 1904, though it could possibly be 'The Gateway' painted in February-March 1902 and exhibited at the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale (758) the same year. A painting entitled 'The Gateway', showing almost exactly the same view by daylight, was included in the Spring Exhibition at the Goupil Gallery, London, in March 1904 (60) and is reproduced in the catalogue.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n From the late 1940s until the early 1960s Prunella Clough regularly chose to depict the working man in an industrial setting. Referring to these pictures Clough suggested retrospectively that they were 'an attempt to introduce the figure into a contemporary urban landscape without the devices of the past, without the myths of Mars or Venus or the legends of Breughel. I was trying to update the classical Western concern with the figure without benefit of religious or mythical context' (quoted in Prunella Clough: New Paintings 1979-82, p.3). \n\nClough often visited the fishing ports along the East Anglian coast and the industrial centres of the Midlands, as well as the streets of London, looking for subject matter. The subsequent pictures were the product of her memories of events or scenes she had encountered. It is not known if Man Hosing Metal Fish Boxes refers to a specific memory or if it is a composite of various recollections and imagination. Nor is it known where it was painted, though it is likely to have been in London where Clough lived and worked. The subdued, earthy colours and angular rendering of form are typical of her work in this period.\n\nIn his essay for the 1960 retrospective at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the critic Michael Middleton suggested that Clough's workmen are the dehumanised automata of the industrial age. The extent to which the figure in Man Hosing Metal Fish Boxes is integrated formally and tonally into his environment might support Middleton's assertion that the worker is 'cast into anonymity by an identification with his labour or surroundings so great that it is not always easy at first to disentangle him' (Prunella Clough: a Retrospective Exhibition, p.9). However, the scale of the man in Man Hosing Metal Fish Boxes, as in her other paintings of similar subjects, is monumental and the figure is in fact easily distinguished from his surroundings. Contradicting Middleton, Margaret Garlake has suggested that 'Clough's workers are simultaneously defined by and define their work, but they are not reduced to mechanical cyphers.

Her early work is characterised by the proletarian subject-matter of labour and the urban landscape described within a narrow tonal range. Towards the end of her life she became regarded largely as an abstractionist, but her work always retained a figurative base, as if form had been filtered through memory. During the 1950s she introduced plant motifs into her urban scenes. In the late 1960s Clough's style became even freer in terms of colour and scale, but it still revealed her continuing fascination with the \u2018edginess' of form, the sudden intrusion of hard shapes into softer areas. From 1946 to 1951 Clough produced etchings, lithographs and paintings of fishermen and dockers in London, East Anglia and the industrial Midlands. Lowestoft Harbour (1951; London, AC England Col.), included in the Festival of Britain's 60 Paintings for '51 exhibition, shows figures depicted in a style derived from Cubism and displays Clough's primary and lasting preoccupation with the potential for abstraction in flatness of form. Later pictures such as Samples (1997; London, AC England Col.) describe colourful objects in shallow space with playful tonal gradations that suggest movement.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n As part of the Festival of Britain celebrations of 1951, the Arts Council invited sixty contemporary artists to submit one large-scale painting each for the 60 Paintings for '51 exhibition. Ayrton's entry was The Captive Seven, which he painted in his studio at All Soul's Place, London. It is one of the largest paintings from his so-called Italian period, a phase that began in 1946 and ended in 1951. Ayrton's frequent visits to Italy during those years stimulated a move away from the North European linearity of his earlier work towards the plasticity and clearly structured monumentality associated with Italian Renaissance painting. He did not, however, entirely forsake the Northern tradition as the grotesque distortions and lurid palette of The Captive Seven, which are indebted to such artists as Matthias Grunewald (c.1475-1528) and Otto Dix (1891-1969), demonstrate. The abject nature of the painting has been contextualised by David Mellor within the general existential malaise that followed the Second World War (1939-45).\n\nAccording to the artist, the painting is an allegory about the corrosive effects of the seven deadly sins, namely Pride, Envy, Avarice, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth and Anger. It is the interplay and interdependence of these sins that interested him. Thus the figures in the painting do not separately personify each sin, instead various sins intermingle within each of the protagonists and thereby imprison them. Ayrton summarised the composition thus:\n\nThe central group is steeped in Pride, the deadliest of all sins, in two separate aspects. The woman's pride is sexual and embraces lust, and in her attitude to the lovemaking pair who form the group on her right is an element of envy. Her mantle is both a matador's cape and the ecclesiastical purple. She flicks money casually into the dirt. The old man in front of her is governed by intellectual pride and it projection, spiritual pride. His envy comes from the death of the physical appetites, from the lust and gluttony he can no longer practice, and anger, provoked by these frustrations, has written on his face. Pride is his refuge and his is the ultimate pass to which others may come.The group comprising the fat woman and the two children is dominated by the juvenile sin of gluttony. The woman has lost her hope of lust satisfied and has fallen into gluttony as a substitute. Envy remains and sloth is the inevitable product of her ungainly body. Anger is directed against the child in red, who in turn envies his brother the doughnuts he greedily eats. The child in red is angered by the simple injustice he finds in the large child's refusal to share the cakes and not less by the pride the naked boy shows in his physical superiority and his ability to possess both doughnuts by force. The naked boy is also possessed by the most childish of sins and eats voraciously. On the right lies a girl, hot and heavy in the sunlight. She is held by lust but her very appetites are dulled by sloth and she holds in one hand the net of ennui which trickles from her across the whole foreground. The young man who seeks to kindle her is motivated towards lust by vanity rather than desire, physical rather than sexual pride. His mind is partly involved also with his interest in the coins which he sees tossed onto the ground in front of him. His avarice is stronger than his lusts because lust to him is pride and pride is better fed with money which can buy the objects of lusts; in him also is envy of one who can treat money so casually. (Ayrton, pp.2-3). \n\nThe building behind this group was itself considered by Ayrton to be a victim of pride. Located in the Vicola della Moretta, Rome, it was half demolished on the orders of the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini (1883-1945). In its place a building in Mussolini's honour was to be built, but in the end the project was never completed. The clothesline, sagging under the weight of the 'rags of hope' (Ayrton, p.4), represents apathy. The town to which the line leads, but significantly stops short of, 'exists solely because no one will ever get to it.' (Ayrton, p.4).\n\nIn 1955 Ayrton repainted parts of the canvas; most noticeably he closed the mouth of the prone female figure on the right and changed the position of her left hand, thereby increasing her disinterested and languid appearance.\n\nFurther reading:David Mellor (ed.), A Paradise Lost: The Neo-Romantic Imagination in Britain 1935-55, exhibition catalogue, Barbican Art Gallery, London 1987, pp.70-1, reproduced p.71, pl.76 (colour)Michael Ayrton, 'Notes on The Captive Seven', Tate ArchiveJustine Hopkins, Michael Ayrton: A Biography, London 1994, pp.164-8\n\nToby TrevesJanuary 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1949\u201350", "dimensions": "Support: 1220 x 1830 mm", "reference": "T05854", "title": "The Captive Seven", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ayrton-the-captive-seven-t05854", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T05/T05854_8.jpg", "artist": "Michael Ayrton", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1921\u20131975", "artistbio": "\n Michael AYRTON b. 1921\n\nPainter and sculptor of imaginative subjects; theatre designer and illustrator; writer and broadcaster.

He studied in art college in Athens until 1956 and then went to Italy. From 1958 to 1960 he produced Alphabets, expanses of colour with letters, numbers, typographical symbols and road markings superimposed. Such works clearly demonstrated his aim of transcending the poetics of Art informel and pursuing a line of study characterised by contradictory concerns with, on the one hand, the symbols of mass urban and industrial civilisation, and on the other, primitive, fundamental, individual values. These were frequently expressed by the artist's physical participation from 1960 in his own exhibitions at La Tartaruga, thus transforming them into performances.\nKounellis's work developed as a spectacular mixture of painting, collages and the staging of installations, \u2018environments', performances and theatrical shows, designed to express the tensions and alienation of contemporary society, and the multiplicity, obscurity and fragmentation of its language. From 1967 he became associated with Arte povera, and his work was characterised by the juxtaposition of objects, materials and actions that were both physically and culturally antithetical to one another. These included raw materials such as stone, cotton, wool and coal, and objets trouv\u00e9s such as bed-frames, doors and, since 1969, shelves. He also used fire, soot and smoke in his installations and in 1969 brought live horses into the Galleria L'Attico in Rome, stressing the fragmentation of modern society by also introducing elements of traditional culture.

Charles Cathcart on the first British Mission to Beijing, a voyage that included visits to Madeira, the Cape of Good Hope and Java. Thereafter he lived by painting landscape oils and watercolours, the subjects culled from his frequent tours. He painted occasional portraits throughout his career. He was also an accomplished figure draughtsman and social observer: he showed four humorous paintings of sailors at the Royal Academy in 1800, a topical theme at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.\nIn straitened circumstances, Ibbetson moved in 1798 to Liverpool. From that year until his death he lived in the north, at Edinburgh, Rosslyn and the Lake District, finally settling at Masham, N. Yorks, in 1805. He married his second wife in 1799 and was unsuccessful as an ARA candidate the following year. Ibbetson's large Lake District oils show a sinuous handling of line that has more in common with 17th-century Dutch paintings than the sparer compositions of Romantic art.

This landscape was commissioned from the artist in about 1960 by Dennis Proctor, who then also lived in the area. \n\nSir Dennis Proctor (1905-1983) was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery in 1953, and became Chairman in the same year, retiring in 1959. He had first met Claude Rogers in 1953, when he commissioned from him a portrait of his wife. He chose the artist since he already admired his portrait in the Tate Gallery (N05345) of his wife's friend Mrs Richard Chilver, painted in 1937-8. The portrait for Dennis Proctor was painted over several years at the artist's studio in Taviton Street, WC1. When it was completed he asked Rogers to paint a landscape for him of the same size and character as his \u2018Clover Fields near Toppesfield Church', 1947, which was then hanging in the sitting room at Taviton Street 915 x 1220, 36 x 48, private collection, repr. Bruce Laughton, The Euston Road School, 1986, p.302). Toppesfield in Essex is near Somerton, and the trees and fields in both paintings look much the same. The paintings are of similar size and composition, with a continuous foreground to middleground, and an emphasis on the growing crop rather than on people, buildings or incident. The later landscape is painted more loosely, and with a more open perspective. \n\nThe Tate Gallery's painting by Elsie Few, Claude Rogers's wife, of \u2018Bradfields' (1947, T03285) is also of the same area. \n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1984-86: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions Including Supplement to Catalogue of Acquisitions 1982-84, Tate Gallery, London 1988, pp.258-9\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1961", "dimensions": "Support: 1016 x 1266 mm", "reference": "T03848", "title": "Cornfields at Somerton", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rogers-cornfields-at-somerton-t03848", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03848_8.jpg", "artist": "Claude Rogers", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1907\u20131979", "artistbio": "\n Claude ROGERS b. 1907\n\nPainter of portraits, landscape and realistic genre.

During World War II Colquhoun joined the Civil Defence Corps but continued to paint. After his early works, for example Tomato Plants (c. 1942; priv. col., see exh. cat., p. 55), he concentrated on the theme of the isolated figure, for example Woman with Leaping Cat (1946; London, Tate). These existential images were favourably received and compared with those of contemporaries such as Francis Bacon. Colquhoun's influences included Pablo Picasso, Jankel Adler and Percy Wyndham Lewis, although his art and lifestyle can be understood best in the context of Scottish nationalism. Always in debt, his decline was delayed briefly by a retrospective exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1958.\nBibliographyA Paradise Lost: The Neo-Romantic Imagination in Britain, 1935\u201355 (exh. cat., ed.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n The painting was executed on a single piece of coarse linen canvas that is attached to an expandable softwood stretcher with ferrous tacks around the tacking edges. The tacks are probably not original, as there is an earlier set of tacking holes along all four edges. The canvas used was commercially primed probably with an initial layer of animal glue size followed by a white pigmented layer composed primarily of lead white in oil. This priming is fairly thin and the canvas weave texture would have still been very apparent through it.The oil paint used appears to have been mainly paste-like in consistency although in many areas the paint appears rather lean presumably due to the addition of diluent. The paint was applied mainly by brush in a rather loose manner using a combination of wet-in-wet and wet-on-dry techniques where more than one layer is present. In addition the handle of a brush has been used in a few areas to scrape back through the paint, for example in the cars and parts of the main boat. Much of the painting seems to consists of two layers of paint, with the under layer being a warm base colour ranging from cream to pink, and the details such as the figures, cars and lamp-posts were all painted over the surrounding background colour. The paint used for these details exhibits a reasonable impasto, in contrast to areas where the paint has been thinned. Here the canvas weave texture is still very apparent. The painting is not varnished and the paint is typically matt, although there is some variation in surface gloss. On acquisition, areas of a rather thick brown paint were seen around many of the painting's edges. By analysis it was possible to identify it as acrylic emulsion paint and to confirm that it was identical to the paint found on the frame. Since these paints were not available until after the artist's death it was concluded that not only had the frame been painted with the painting still inside it, but also this could not have been carried out by the artist. The original finish to the frame is a warm grey colour which is still visible in areas where the brown paint has not been applied, in particular along its top edge. The painting is in overall good condition. Although the fabric is somewhat degraded, it still exhibits reasonable flexibility and strength. The painting was recently cleaned to remove a layer of household dirt from its surface and the areas of brown acrylic paint from around its edges, both of which have resulted in a considerable improvement to its appearance. The frame has also been fitted with glazing and a backboard to provide additional protection to the painting.Tom LearnerJanuary 1998\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1928", "dimensions": "Support: 1020 x 1270 mm", "reference": "T07230", "title": "Stockholm in Winter", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bone-stockholm-in-winter-t07230", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07230_8.jpg", "artist": "Stephen Bone", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1904\u20131958", "artistbio": "\n Stephen Bone was born in London, the son of the artist and etcher Sir Muirhead Bone (1876-1953). He lived in\nItaly from 1910 to 1912. Educated at Bedales School, he studied at the Slade School of Art from 1922 to 1924 under Henry Tonks, and in 1925 won a gold medal for wood engraving in the International Exhibition in Paris. That year he toured Spain with his\nfather. After 1920 he also travelled to France, Greece and Scandinavia. In 1929 he married the painter Mary Adshead (1904-95), who had been a fellow student at the Slade School. They travelled extensively in Greece, Italy and the British Isles.From\n1920 Bone exhibited with the New English Art Club, becoming a member in 1932. In 1926 he held an exhibition with Robin Guthrie and Rodney Burn at the Goupil Gallery, London. He exhibited widely in the 1930s, showing landscapes and portraits with the\nRoyal Academy, the Fine Art Society, the Lefevre Gallery, and the Redfern Gallery. A 1936 exhibition at Ryman's Galleries, Oxford contained oil paintings Bone had made of forty-one British counties. He painted and exhibited in Stockholm, Sweden in 1936\nand 1937.In addition to landscapes, Bone painted the occasional portrait (see, for example, Charles Aitken, exhibited 1932, Tate Gallery N04618). In 1925 his woodcuts illustrated the book Of the\nWestern Isles by his mother, Lady Gertrude (n\u00e9e Dodd) Bone. In 1928 he painted a decoration for Piccadilly Circus Underground Station, which was later replaced by advertisements. In 1939 he published Albion: An Artist's Britain,\nillustrated with his landscapes. From 1936 to 1939 he served on the committee of the Artists' International Association, helping artist refugees from Germany to live and work in Britain. During the Second World War he served as a civilian camouflage\nofficer, 1939-43, and as an Official War Artist attached to the Navy, 1943-5. In 1946 he published British Weather in the Collins' 'Britain in Pictures' series. He was art critic to the Manchester Guardian from 1948, and in the\n1950s emerged as a broadcaster, frequently serving on the panel of the BBC radio programmes 'The Critics' and 'The Brains Trust', and on the long-running and very popular television programme 'Animal, Vegetable and Mineral'. He also contributed\nregularly to the Yorkshire Post, and to the Glasgow Herald as 'Luggage McLuggage', author of humorous travel articles. In the 1950s Bone and Adshead organised a mural painting course at Dartington. He wrote several children's books, including The\nSilly Snail, The Little Boy and his House and The Little Boy and his Boat, which were illustrated by his wife, sometimes with his collaboration. He was also the author of the Shell Guide to the West Coast of Scotland. In\n1957 he was appointed the Director of Hornsey College of Art, but the appointment was cut short by his early death, in London.Further reading:Stephen Bone, Albion: An Artist's Britain, London 1939Stephen\nBone, exhibition card, Sally Hunter &amp; Patrick Seale Fine Art, London 1986Terry RiggsNovember 1997\n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1997"},

He was the best travelled of the New York painters, and the breadth of his training and art-historical knowledge served him well in his teaching, which was his principal means of support during the mid 1930s.\nIn a letter that Gottlieb and Rothko wrote to the New York Times in June 1943, they laid the theoretical foundations for Abstract expressionism. \nGottlieb had begun using primitive, timeless images in the Pictographs initiated in 1941 after his return to New York. Whenever Gottlieb discovered that one of his signs had an actual precedent in a past culture, he dropped it from his painting vocabulary, thereby rendering his work \u2018mute'. This was his gesture towards a universal grammar, or principle of order common to all humanity. Gottlieb hoped that by calling attention to the fundamental properties of language, he would involve spectators in a universal experience.\nBy the early 1950s his Pictographs had been superseded by a series of Imaginary Landscapes. The Burst series that followed presented a radically simplified image. They usually consisted of two shapes, a red disc above a writhing black mass near the bottom of the picture. Together these forms, in various combinations, continued to play out not only the relationship of object to ground in landscape painting, but also an almost theatrical confrontation of two protagonists as in history painting. Gottlieb distilled the most fundamental relationships out of a complex of sensations re-created with the utmost economy.\nBibliographyM. Friedman: Adolph Gottlieb (Minneapolis, 1963)H.

In this work a futurist feeling for form was introduced, and yet it reverts back to abstract paintings of 1955\u20136in the pictorial use of an actual frame.\nAs on previous occasions he removed some ornamentation from the frame, here powder blue rather than gilt, because it was important to him that although he might be painting on an object, as a painting, its surface should still be essentially flat (cf.T01689). Some blue paint remained and is still visible. The oval inscribed around the composition has no still-life reference. It is a cubist convention which complements the rectangular real frame on which it and the picture are painted. The template used to draw this motif was itself a frame and provided in turn the support for another painting made sometime afterwards.\nThe subject of this painting was a shelf at one end of a mirrored sideboard in the family home at Hunwick. The shelf was square and may be seen tilted forward at the centre of the composition. Resting on two legs, its construction was not altogether unlike a small chair; a fact that probably attracted him to the subject as chairs had been a favourite theme. The piece of furniture was of Spanish mahogany and had a dark, maroon red sheen. It would seem that the word \u2018sideboard\u2019 in the title refers as much to the framing surround of the work as to the subject matter. The terms \u2018abstraction\u2019 or \u2018abstract\u2019 were often used in titling up to this time. In \u2018Sideboard Abstraction\u2019 the forces of Futurism radiate from cubist still-life only to be contained in turn by the cubist vignette as if Cubism through its convention was preventing Futurism from becoming fully operational throughout the space of the room. Although the two movements co-exist and are stylistically almost the same thing, there is much that is complicated and contradictory. The illusionary oval frame is more emphatic and effective at framing than the real frame. Deflections from picture plane to picture frame echo the reflections refracted along the bevel of the mirror which comes into the picture from the right. The bevelled edge is seen at the top right as a sliver of light contravening the aforesaid laws of the two framing systems when it asserts itself up to the mitre at that corner. A coincidence of light, scumbled over a wadge of pigment. Other interlocking slabs of paint made with a palette knife are grouped nearby. The artist believes that the glazes and delicate white washes below to the right originated in the mirror. Artist\u2019s brushes in a vase are represented at the top left of the picture. Across this area a small cascade of particles finds itself free of the formal structure, and this capricious condition was to become prevalent in later paintings.\nPublished in The Tate Gallery Report 1972\u20131974, London 1975.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint and enamel paint on wood", "date": "1957", "dimensions": "Support: 502 x 425 mm", "reference": "T01690", "title": "Sideboard Abstraction", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/stephenson-sideboard-abstraction-t01690", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01690_8.jpg", "artist": "Ian Stephenson", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1934\u20132000", "artistbio": "\n Ian STEPHENSON b. 1934\n\nAbstract painter.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Adshead included Morning after the Flood in her first solo show at the Goupil Gallery, London in 1930. It is typical of the style of 'decorative painting' that was taught at the Slade School of Art, which Adshead attended from 1921 to 1924 under Professor Henry Tonks. The Slade School tutors regularly set figure compositions for their students, in which the prescribed subject matter was taken from the Bible, and Adshead kept to that practice in this work. The painting depicts the day following the subsidence of the biblical Flood, when Noah's Ark came to rest on dry land. In the small catalogue which accompanied her 1986 show at Sally Hunter Fine Art, Noel Carrington wrote of Adshead's 'sense of design, wit and joie de vivre'. These qualities are evident in this work, particularly in the inclusion of the elephant, camel and kangaroo. Adshead's son Sylvester Bone called Morning after the Flood 'the most mysterious picture of [Adshead's] that I know' (letter to Tate Gallery, 30 June 1997).\n\nFurther reading:\nMary Adshead, exhibition catalogue, Sally Hunter &amp; Patrick Seale Fine Art, London 1986\nKaty Deepwell (ed.), Ten Decades: Careers of Ten Women Artists born 1897-1906, exhibition catalogue, Norwich Gallery, Norwich 1992\n\nTerry Riggs\nDecember 1997\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Tempera on canvas", "date": "1928", "dimensions": "Support: 515 x 427 mm", "reference": "T07228", "title": "Morning after the Flood", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/adshead-morning-after-the-flood-t07228", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07228_8.jpg", "artist": "Mary Adshead", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1904\u20131995", "artistbio": "\n Adshead was born in London. She was taught watercolour painting by her father Stanley, an architect and\nProfessor of Civic Design at the University of London. She spent 1919-20 in Paris, then attended the Slade School of Art under Professor Henry Tonks from 1921 to 1924. In 1924 Tonks arranged her first mural project with Rex Whistler, who was a fellow\nstudent, at the Highways Club, Shadwell. This project led, in 1925, to a commission to decorate a dining room for Professor Charles Reilly in Liverpool. The decorations were exhibited at the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1926, before their\nfinal installation. They are now on display at Liverpool University. In 1929 she married the artist Stephen Bone, son of the well known artist and etcher Sir Muirhead Bone. The couple made many painting and sketching tours through Europe.Exhibitions\nin which she participated include the Applied Art Exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, 1926, and the Art in Industry Exhibition at Burlington House, 1935. She exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1927, and with the Women's International\nArt Club from the mid-1930s, serving on their Committee in 1951. In 1930 she held a solo show at the Goupil Gallery, and was elected a member of the New English Art Club that year. She had solo shows at Sally Hunter &amp; Patrick Seale Fine Art in 1986 and\n1989.In 1931 Adshead began a series of drawings and watercolours of the Crystal Palace, London. She and Bone produced murals for Cunard's liner Queen Mary in 1935-6, but they were not installed. In 1937 she produced wall panels to decorate\nthe British Pavilion at the Paris International Exhibition. She produced stamp designs in 1949, 1951 and 1953. In 1952-3 she and Bone organised and taught at Dartington Summer Painting School. From 1953 through the 1960s she was Secretary of the Society\nof Mural Painters. In 1957 she painted a triptych for St Mary and All Angel's Church, Plymstock, Plymouth. Her growing interest in mosaic design led her in 1962 to study at Ravenna and in Sicily, and to take a course in the techniques of Italian mosaic\ndesign at Kingston Art School. In 1966 she produced a decorative pool in mosaic, marble, stones and cable sections in the Telephone Exchange Courtyard, Guernsey. In 1983 she embarked on a major mosaic mural project for a pedestrian subway in\nRotherhithe, London. In the 1980s and 1990s she made sketching tours in Malta, Turkey and Madeira.Her numerous public and private mural commissions include decorations (no longer extant) for London Underground for Bank Station (1926) and Piccadilly\nCircus Station (1928), racing murals for Lord Beaverbrook (1928), murals for Vauxhall Motors, Westminster Hall, and Luton Hoo House in the 1940s, decorations for Selfridges restaurant (begun 1949, destroyed 1967), and designs for the Ministry of Works\n(1954) and the Commonwealth Institute (1967).

She then studied at the Fine Arts School, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY (1962\u20135); she also studied sculpture at the State University of New York, Buffalo (summer 1964). In the mid 1960s influences upon her included Lucas Samaras, Larry Poons, Jasper Johns and Robert Morris. Rothenberg moved to New York in 1969 and lived among a dedicated community of both young and established artists. She briefly assisted Nancy Graves and appeared in several performances by Joan Jonas (b. 1936). After an important period of experimentation with process art from 1969 to 1972 she painted her first early mature works depicting horses, for which she became renowned. The painting Axes (1976; New York, MOMA) and other images that include isolated body fragments, dancers, spinners and other figures are autobiographical in origin; in them she explored and articulated an interest in the unconscious process.

Took a BA degree at Government College, Lahore, 1957 and a law degree at the University of the Punjab 1959; called to the Bar of Pakistan at the age of 20.\nWent to London in 1960 and decided to become a professional painter; first retrospective exhibition at the Alfred Brod Galleries, London, 1962. Awarded a Huntington Hartford Foundation fellowship 1962 and moved to New York. More or less stopped painting\nin 1965 as a gesture of protest against the contemporary art world, but continued to devise a series of iconoclastic conceptual projects.

To abstract means \"to take from\" ... \n\n'It will be better if I say a little about my \"development.\" I had to follow many paths, before I came to what I now consider to be the task facing me ... \n\n'It is a fact that at the beginning my work showed a leaning towards German mysticism, and that, after I had made my first pictures out of this world of medieval thought and belief, my work was influenced by a man who came from the East - by the Orientalist Ernst Grosse. Through him and through a twenty-year stay in his house, I moved from German to Eastern mysticism - to Zen philosophy. This was long before it became fashionable in Europe ... to be precise in the year 1918. \n\n'All the works from the preparatory period were burnt before the war - in 1934 - in a big fire in the attic of the University at Freiburg, where I taught. Among the pictures destroyed were all the first \"abstract\" works, to which I had turned in the year 1929. And thus I found myself faced with the inescapable fact and knowledge (as I then thought) that all the traditional problems of representational painting could be resolved. I began thenceforth with contrasts of very simple planes and linear characters - waves and straight lines. These characters led me however at the beginning of the 'thirties into my own pictorial world ... \n\n'At the beginning stands the hard-won personal conviction, at the end its lucid formulation. Yet all formulation is vain if it does not come from within - I might say if it has not become an expression of one's inner self.' \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.54-5, reproduced p.54 \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Tempera on fabric", "date": "1959", "dimensions": "Support: 200 x 235 mm", "reference": "T00362", "title": "20 Jan. 59 Zurich", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bissier-20-jan-59-zurich-t00362", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00362_8.jpg", "artist": "Julius Bissier", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1893\u20131965", "artistbio": "\n Julius Bissier 1893-1965German painter and designer.

Usually the path was traced by one thread which met itself eventually, forming a loop, hence \u201cLooped Network\u201d. (An alternative title for this series is \u201cUnicursal Curve\u201d).\n\n\u2018The painting derives from one particular model in the series, shown in 1969 at the Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Biennal, Antwerp. I also made concurrently a drawing, (one of several versions) which was subsequently sold. When I was invited to take part in \u201cBritish Painting '74\u201d ... it was made clear ...that the works must be totally flat ... Given this condition I decided to use an enlargement of the \u201cLooped Network\u201d drawing with another colour resolution; in fact to treat it as an enlarged drawing rather than as a painting as such, the difference being that I wanted to embed it in pictorial space rather than the neutral one of drawings. A classical one that had been interesting me for other reasons was a vertical rectangle (in this case a 3:4 ratio) 64\u00d748, centralised image 32\u00d732 surrounded by equi-distant white \u201cspace\u201d but held on the picture plane top and bottom by a line of light-toned squares which slightly counter-balance the diagonal emphasis of the network.\u2019\n\nThe red/blue contrast in the network is one of the artist's preferred colour combinations, although she tends to prefer neutral schemes. She uses colour mostly diagrammatically-in this case as a means of establishing different positions in space.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1974-6: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1978\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on plastic", "date": "1974", "dimensions": "Support: 1626 x 1219 x 23 mm", "reference": "T01965", "title": "Looped Network Suspended in Pictorial Space", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wise-looped-network-suspended-in-pictorial-space-t01965", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01965_8.jpg", "artist": "Gillian Wise", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1936", "artistbio": "\n Gillian WISE b. 1936\n\nConstructivist artist.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n The following entry is based on an interview with the artist, 5th December, 1996The picture is painted on a piece of 12oz cotton duck canvas, supplied by Russell &amp; Chapple, stretched over a wooden strainer made by the artist. The canvas was prepared with three layers of Golden's Acrylic Gesso Primer. The thin initial coat was diluted with water which had the desired effect of stretching the canvas until it was taut and flat. The second coat was applied full strength, and the final coat had a small addition of water added to the primer before it was brushed out to form a smooth, even layer.The composition is executed with oil paint of a certain kind of consistency made by Callery himself. The actual paint is lead white which I've made from lead white pigment from Cornelissens ... I mix it with refined linseed oil, so it's just a straight forward oil paint with no fillers or anything else in it. The primed surface was covered with a layer of lead white paint into which the lines were then worked. The thin coloured lines were made with Sennelier chalk pastel sticks, drawn across the dry and still wet areas of turpentine thinned paint where the pastel has bled into the paint, creating the appearance of lines strewn across and below the white painted surface. Callery worked with brushes and a scalpel to adjust a line, or to scrape back and remove areas of paint. He described his method of painting the work as, not process orientated in the sense that there is one layer of paint, one layer of line, one layer of paint, one layer of line ... it is much more organic. I might put an area of paint, an area of line, take off a line, or put in another area of paint. It's built up unevenly and worked in sections really. I can't work over the entire surface at the same time, although when I start the first thing I do is cover the whole thing in white oil and then work into that. The whole painting becomes, a process of countless little marks, removing and adding paint until I get to the point where I can see it's a finished work.The painting is not framed as the artist prefers to, think about the painting in terms of it's physicality as an object that exists the way I made it ... the edges, the depth, all those things are integral parts of the work, anything put on that would change the work.Jo CrookDecember 1997\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1996", "dimensions": "Support: 2540 x 3600 mm", "reference": "T07119", "title": "Archive", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/callery-archive-t07119", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07119_8.jpg", "artist": "Simon Callery", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1960", "artistbio": "\n English painter and draughtsman. He originally trained as a sculptor, graduating from Cardiff College of Art in 1983, but from 1985 devoted himself to painting. In 1987 he returned to London. His paintings at this time originated as views across the urban landscape, yet through a prolonged process of abstraction resulted in a far more ambiguous image. His later work remained formally consistent but became increasingly refined in conception and execution. Large canvases in a muted palette, registering subtle changes and with direct reference to source imagery kept obscure, typified his production of the 1990s. Frank about the romantic intentions governing his work, Callery made paintings that demand contemplation: detailed variation in surface area is as important as the overall composition. His paintings are often densely worked, but with the paint thinly applied; the surface consists of numerous finely made vertical and horizontal lines of paint, charcoal and chalk. In 1991 Callery organised his first one-person exhibition in a converted warehouse. His work was soon being shown alongside that of other Young British Artists although his work could be seen as more traditional than that of many artists of his generation. Although painting remained at the centre of his art, in 1997, in collaboration with photographer Alan Watson, Callery explored similar themes in a large-scale photographic piece documenting in detail the surface of an archaeological dig supervised jointly by the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the Pitt Rivers Museum.\nBibliographyP.

A larger oil version (622\u00d7990, 24 1/2\u00d738 3/4), in the collection of the Marylebone Cricket Club (fig.2), appears to correspond in all details with the engraving; it bears the initials \u2018R.H.\u2019 lower left (? the reversed initials of H. Roberts, the engraver), and may be the first version in oil. The Tate Gallery picture differs from the engraving and the MCC version in such details as the colours of dress, the pose of the two men seated on the grass in the upper centre, keeping the score, where the right-hand figure turns his head away towards the fielders instead of concentrating on his tally-stick, and in the omission of one group of four spectators in the background on the left. Versions in oil have also been reported in private collections in England and in the USA (the latter having a wooded landscape background). One state of the engraving of \u2018An Exact Representation of the Game of Cricket\u2019 (fig.3) is stated by Cardus and Arlott to be dedicated \u2018to all Gentlemen Lovers of that Diversion\u2019; perhaps there was an enthusiastic market among them for versions in oil, a market probably stimulated by the publication in 1744 of the first \u2018Laws of Cricket\u2019 (quoted in Cardus and Arlott, p.12).

He came to painting from a successful surgical career. From 1887 he studied at Westminster School of Art, and in 1891 exhibited his first paintings at the New English Art Club. In 1893 he finally abandoned medicine on being invited to join the staff of the Slade School of Art in London, where he taught until 1930. His overriding concern with draughtsmanship and the structure of the body was apparent in his programme of copying from the Antique, from prints and from life; however, he saw this discipline as the basis for developing each artist's individuality. He influenced such students as Augustus John, Stanley Spencer, Wyndham Lewis, Mark Gertler and Rex Whistler. At the Slade he originated \u2018Tonking', a method of removing excess oil from canvas with newspaper, which was taught in art schools into the 1950s.\nTonks was himself a fine draughtsman whose knowledge of anatomy complemented his fascination with light effects. His mature works combine expressive manipulation of forms with pure, bright colour, while retaining an attraction for implicit anecdote. This led him to deplore the influence of Roger Fry and Post-Impressionism. During World War I he made pastel drawings of wounded soldiers for use in plastic surgery, and painted the large Advanced Dressing Station in France: 1918 (London, Imp. War Mus.), a government commission. His other commissions include Founders' Murals (1922) for University College, London. After retiring from the Slade he continued to defend craftsmanship and observation against modernism as represented by Fry.\nBibliographyJ.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Crawhall painted birds of all varieties, from pigeons and magpies to pheasants and Chinese geese. In general he preferred to depict them in their natural habitat, as in A Mallard Rising (c.1908, private collection), but occasionally he would paint birds in captivity. The Aviary, Clifton (1888, The Burrell Collection, Glasgow), one of Crawhall's finest works, is another rare example of a picture which features caged birds. Crawhall's sister Elspeth noted that her brother 'loved animals and would not use them for base purposes for he respected their individuality too much' (quoted in Hamilton 1990, p.123). Unlike many Victorian artists, Crawhall avoided the sentimental depiction of birds and animals, and was interested in capturing their essence in a spontaneous and often witty manner. A gifted caricaturist, he could convey a creature's individual character with a few strokes of his pen or brush. As his contemporary, John Lavery (1856-1940), remarked, 'In a few lines he could sketch an animal, making it more recognisable than the most candid camera could do - and this from memory' (Lavery, The Life of a Painter, London 1940, p.82).\n\nAlthough born and brought up in Morpeth, Crawhall was a leading member of the Glasgow Boys, whose early work is strongly realist in style and subject matter. However, by the 1890s they had adopted a more decorative approach and, as Adrian Bury notes, this picture is 'more symbolical than realistic, in [that] the bird is subordinated to the design as a whole' (Bury 1958, p.119). Crawhall contrasts the vertical bars of the cage with the horizontals of the perch, the feeding dish and the dove itself, which appears hunched up and subdued. At the same time he softens the grid-like design through the varied colours and tones and the half-dry brush effect. The artist has clearly worked rapidly, drawing freehand lines with a casual deftness. From an early date Crawhall specialised in watercolours and he most often painted in gouache on a linen support. In The Dove the warm Holland linen provides the background colour to the picture. The calligraphic handling and economy of line reflect Crawhall's interest in Oriental art, as do the Japanese-style blossoms outside the cage. \n\nFurther reading:Adrian Bury, Joseph Crawhall, the Man and the Artist, London 1958, p.76, reproduced p.119.Vivien Hamilton, Joseph Crawhall, Glasgow 1990, p.126.\n\nFrances Fowle4 December 2000 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Watercolour on silk", "date": "c.1895", "dimensions": "Support: 241 x 305 mm", "reference": "N03680", "title": "The Dove", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/crawhall-the-dove-n03680", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N03/N03680_8.jpg", "artist": "Joseph Crawhall", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1861\u20131913", "artistbio": "\n Joseph CRAWHALL 1861\u20131913\n\nPainter in watercolour, chiefly of birds and animals.

His early paintings are figurative. In 1957 he moved to Portugal with Paula Rego, whom he married in 1959. He painted very little during his time in Portugal and subsequently destroyed much of the work of that period. When he and his family returned to London in 1974, settling permanently there, he began to paint again as a way of supporting himself. The paintings from the late 1970s were made after hallucinating the images, possibly a side-effect from the drugs he was taking at the time for multiple sclerosis. Primitive shelters and furniture, as settings suggestive of the isolation of the artist, are motifs that he explored in many works of this time. Willing also drew, not only preparatory sketches, but finished works, on a smaller scale than the large paintings, as in Untitled 14.12.82 (1982; Cambridge, U. of Cambridge, Kettle's Yard), which shows an unstable pile of objects in a bleak landscape. In the 1980s Willing was recognised as an important and established artist, but his health was worsening. He painted on a smaller scale at this time, with a series of women's heads being the last series that he completed before his death from multiple sclerosis.

His father, also Allan Ramsay, was an important Scottish poet from whom the\nyounger Ramsay inherited a tradition of strong nationalistic pride. Ramsay junior was instrumental in formulating a native Scottish style of painting, as his father had done for poetry. Ramsay studied in London at St Martin's Lane Academy and at\nHans Hysing's studio, before going to Italy. He worked from 1736 to 1738 at the French Academy in Rome under Francesco Imperiali and under Francesco Solimena in Naples. On his return he settled in London, although he continued to be active in\nEdinburgh. Between 1754 and 1757 he was in Italy, mostly in Rome. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1743. During his prime period he had a virtual monopoly on court painting. The envy this aroused is manifested in a remark made by\nRamsay's competitor Joshua Reynolds that Ramsay was 'not a good painter' (quoted in Smart 1952, p.106). He became the official painter to George III in 1760, and Principal Painter-in-Ordinary in 1767. His assistants included David Martin, Alexander\nNasmyth and Philip Reinagle. Ramsay was a correspondent of Voltaire and Rousseau, and a writer of poetry and essays. In On Ridicule (1753) he wrote that truth was 'the leading and inseparable principle in all works of art' (quoted in Smart\n1952, p.70). Other essays include Dialogue on Taste (1755), and The Investigator (1762). After a crippling injury to his arm, he retired to Rome in 1782. He died on the journey home, at Dover.Further\nreading:Alastair Smart, The Life and Art of Allan Ramsay, London 1952Alastair Smart, Allan Ramsay: Painter, Essayist and Man of the Enlightenment, New Haven and London 1992Terry RiggsJanuary 1998\n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1992"},

In an unpublished memoir of the years 1905\u201330, Anthony Gross writes that in April 1927 \u2018I came to Paris, went to Lefebvre-Foinet and asked them where I could go about 400 miles or so south of Paris to paint. They consulted and said I could do no worse than to start at Brive-la-Gaillarde [Corr\u00e8ze]. So with that I loaded up with canvas, stretchers and paints. That evening I bought a one way ticket to Brive\u2019. In Brive he asked in turn about a good local village in which to paint and as a result spent the rest of 1927 and 1928 painting in nearby Chasteaux. After a spell at Toulouse early in 1929 (etching at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts), he went to St Tropez, where \u2018I had the opportunity of continuing my summer's work in the winter and that continuity made the break through for me\u2019 (letter, 1 July 1982). \u2018The larger town meant more people around. I painted very much under the influence of van Gogh, and started some excellent pictures and began really to obtain what I wanted\u2019 (memoir). \u2018I felt van Gogh had an extraordinarily vivid way of painting. His subjects were (at the time) brand new! His graphic way was an inspiration to me\u2019 (letter). Gross painted again in Chasteaux from April 1929 until he went for a few weeks to the small village of Bach near Cahors \u2018and really started painting good pictures. In September I went to Brive where I painted more good pictures, and eventually took all these pictures back to Paris\u2019 (memoir). The Tate's picture was one of those painted in September 1929.\n\nBrive-la-Gaillarde \u2018is an important town - the \u201cGateway to the Midi\u201d. Particularly known for early peaches (pink) and asparagus... There are a number of Brive paintings, the best is this one\u2019 (letter). Several of the others are also of the Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. \u2018I used to paint each picture at a single go. As I soon ran out of canvas, I scraped them down and repainted over them. Some had several \u201c\u00e9bauches\u201d on them before the final picture. This resulted in a build up of colour ... Yes there is a form of writing in the way I paint and draw\u2019 (ibid.). \u2018I do not paint tones, in fact I draw into the paint WITH COLOUR\u2019 (additional note, 23 December 1982).\n\n'I remember while painting this picture and others having been followed by a group of young people, and on this occasion a girl said to me \u201cEt Monsieur qu'est ce que vous pensez de la Perspective?\u201d to which I replied \u201cMademoiselle je m'en fous de la Perspective!\u201d. Later I found they were students of the local artist, whom I met, who had sent them off to harry me!\u2019 (ibid.). Gross's concern was with spatial rather than linear perspective. He continually exercises perspective, for example by placing a whole distant figure immediately beside a close-up ear, both being the same size in the picture. He tries in ways like this to find as many contrasts as possible, in order to maximise the plasticity of the whole.\n\n'I was asked the question at the time \u201cWhat was I trying to do\u201d. I answered (it was Tristram Hillier) \u201cto paint life as it existed but more so!\u201d\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nThree of Gross's prints relate to this painting. Preceded by their numbers in the catalogue of his prints they are:\n\n57.\t\u2018Le Square\u2019 1929, burin, plate size 4 3/4 \u00d7 3 1/8in. Edition of 15. Although this shows a square in Paris, the girl standing behind a bicycle towards the print's lower edge is a reference to the central figure in the Tate's painting.\n\n59.\t\u2018Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Brive\u2019 1930, burin. This was a Christmas card in an edition of about 30 examples, none of which have been traced. The image was quite close to that of the Tate's painting.\n\n65.\t\u2018Girl with Umbrella, Brive-la-Gaillarde\u2019 1930, etching, plate size 6 1/8 \u00d7 7 7/8in. Edition of 40. This etching after another painting shows a different square in Brive-la-Gaillarde, but is closely comparable to the Tate's painting in the disposition of figures and bicycles across the foreground, in front of a wide square with buildings beyond.\n\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1984\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1929", "dimensions": "Support: 813 x 1000 mm", "reference": "T03318", "title": "Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Brive-la-Gaillarde", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gross-place-du-theatre-brive-la-gaillarde-t03318", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03318_8.jpg", "artist": "Anthony Gross", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1905\u20131984", "artistbio": "\n English painter and printmaker. He trained in London, Paris and Madrid from 1923 to 1925, specialising in etching. In 1926 he settled in France, where he created a number of animated films between 1931 and 1939; in 1936 the first of many books illustrated by him was published, an edition of Jean Cocteau's Les Enfants terribles. His oil paintings of this period are largely affectionate depictions of French and English life and leisure, as in Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Brive-la-Gaillarde (1929; London, Tate). Gross returned to England in 1939 and from 1941 to 1946 served as an Official War Artist, covering campaigns in El Alamein, India, Burma, Iran and Normandy; among the works produced in this connection are three watercolours depicting episodes in the Liberation and Battle of France (1944; London, Tate). After World War II he divided his time between France and England, where in 1965 he became the first President of the Print Makers Council. From the 1950s he adopted an increasingly emphatic line and densely packed compositions, particularly in his etchings, for which he remained best known, and devoted much of his attention to landscape, as in Wheatfield (etching, 1966; London, Tate).\nBibliographyThe Etchings of Anthony Gross (exh. cat. by G.

It was also inspired by the 'enclosed' world of the Arthurian legends.

The outermost of these were reinforced by 'spokes'. Isolated clusters of incident were then painted in the remaining area, the largest being a mass of dark line. Finally, Cohen continued, over these, the ever expanding contours generated by the first shape, before ending the painting in the centre of the spiral at bottom left.\n \n \n \n September 2004\n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint and tempera on canvas", "date": "1964", "dimensions": "Support: 1830 x 1834 mm", "reference": "T01162", "title": "Floris", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/cohen-floris-t01162", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01162_8.jpg", "artist": "Bernard Cohen", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1933", "artistbio": "\n English painter. After studying in London at St Martin's School of Art (1950\u201351) and the Slade School of Fine Art (1951\u20134), he went to Paris (1954\u20136). From the early 1960s he began producing paintings that were idiosyncratic and deliberately disparate in style. The intertwined, meandering lines in a painting such as Knot (1962; Belfast, Ulster Mus.) soon began to be rendered as a dizzying profusion with the aid of an airbrush in works such as Untitled Diamond (1964; Minneapolis, MN, Walker A. Cent.); the latter is one of a group of works in which strips of masking tape were removed to reveal the underpainting beneath. The consistent development of procedures arising from a concern with process (which had its roots in both the Abstract Expressionism of Jackson Pollock and the sense of ritual characteristic of Cohen's Orthodox Jewish upbringing) was the link uniting paintings of otherwise bewilderingly varied appearance.\nIn the mid 1970s Cohen exchanged his earlier preferences for broad expanses of flat colour, spontaneously applied paint and soft focus, for a meticulous technique and a dense layering of patterns and motifs. In these paintings, which swarm vertiginously with textures, colours, stencilled and drawn shapes, Cohen found a way of relating his obsession with the procedures of painting to a range of social rituals, producing an art as complex in formal terms as in its metaphorical implications.\nBibliographyBernard Cohen (exh. cat., London, Hayward Gal., 1972)J.

His \u2018fat pigment\u2019 technique had a parallel in Richard Wilson who, like Dall, worked for many years in Italy. It is therefore not surprising that the picture entered the collection as a Wilson and was until recently catalogued as a work of the Wilson School, although Grant correctly attributed it to Dall on grounds of style as early as 1926.\nDuring the restoration of the painting in 1969 the initials \u2018NT\u2019 were recorded on the back of the relining canvas; they appear to have been executed in a distinctive cursive script which matches the known signatures of the artist.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n In the early 1980s, Fielding's work saw a shift from the abstract, gestural painting\nwhich had characterised his early pictures to a style which was more allusive in character and, in terms of composition, more suggestive of still life. In Cherry the connotations of still life are pronounced. Various elements are arranged on an\nasymmetrical field of red, which implies a surface such as a tabletop, while providing a backdrop for character-like images such as the looping brushstroke at the left. This brushstroke recalls the calligraphic character of Fielding's paintings of the\n1970s, which drew inspiration from Japanese brush painting. On the right, various circular forms suggest, among other things, a bowl, a pair of cherries and, at the top right corner, a dish containing apples or pears. These shapes can also be read as a\nfigure - the cherry sprig as an outstretched arm with pointing finger, the incised lines describing fruit in the dish evoking the eye-sockets of a skull. Cherry can therefore be understood as a memento mori. Fielding was aware that he\nwas terminally ill, and the skeletal finger and skull were recurrent images in his work at this time.Further reading:Brian Fielding: New Paintings and Paintings 1960-1983, exhibition catalogue, Mappin Art Gallery,\nSheffield 1986, reproduced p.13 in colourTerry RiggsNovember 1997\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1986", "dimensions": "Support: 1727 x 2032 mm", "reference": "T07233", "title": "Cherry", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fielding-cherry-t07233", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07233_8.jpg", "artist": "Brian Fielding", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1933\u20131986", "artistbio": "\n Fielding was born in Sheffield. He studied at Sheffield College of Art from 1950 to 1954, and the Royal\nCollege of Art from 1954 to 1957. He received an Abbey Minor Travelling Scholarship to Italy and France in 1958. He began participating in group exhibitions in 1954. In 1958 he held his first solo exhibition, at Hibbert Gallery, Sheffield. Other solo\nexhibitions were held at Rowan Gallery, London (1962, 1964), Sheffield University (1969), Consort Gallery, London (1974), St Paul's Gallery, Leeds (1980), Morley Gallery, London (1984), and other venues. A retrospective of his work was held at Mappin\nArt Gallery, Sheffield in 1986. From 1969 to 1982 he taught at Ravensbourne College of Art and Design.In common with many other painters of his generation, the experience of seeing Abstract Expressionist painting at the Tate Gallery in exhibitions\nheld there in 1956 and 1959 was decisive and formative, leading to his subsequent conversion to painterly abstraction. From 1960 until the artist's early death in 1986, he remained committed to an approach to painting in which abstract form (albeit of\na kind resonant with association), colour, drawing, and an emphasis on painterly brushwork are key elements.Further reading:Brian Fielding: New Paintings and Paintings 1960-1983, exhibition catalogue, Mappin Art Gallery,\nSheffield 1986Terry RiggsNovember 1997 \n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1997"},

Although born in Wales, he grew up in Glasgow. He first produced abstract paintings in 1930 while a pupil at Glasgow School of Art (1927\u201331) and, despite discouragement, continued to do so secretly at the Royal College of Art (1932\u20134), inspired by visits to Paris. He was a peripheral member of the Surrealist group in London, although his work had Cubist elements. In 1938 he moved to South Africa to teach at the Natal Technical College in Durban, where he lived until he became an engineer with the South African army in North Africa and Italy (1942\u20135). He then began to paint anti-war subjects, depicting violent allegories of World War II in a style that was an idiosyncratic development of Vorticism. In part abstract, and in lurid colours, these were sometimes based on specific incidents. \nIn the 1950s Evans examined the expressive power of abstract shape and became a leading British printmaker, reviving the technique of mezzotint for large-scale prints. His six aquatints Vertical Suite in Black (1958) used shapes from primitive art, while the Pentaptych mezzotints (1961) shared the geometrical abstraction of his paintings of the 1960s. Evans's large post-war paintings were often based on the patterns made by crowds of people and were intended as a public art on an architectural scale. His work became increasingly abstract and geometrical but retained a feeling of confrontation or movement by means of black outline and colour contrast.\nBibliographyMerlyn Evans (exh. cat., intro.

Worked as a ceramic artist, painting figure subjects on porcelain in the Boullemeir style. Became Master of Life Painting at Bristol, a post he held at the time of his marriage in 1907. Moved to London and after some success with his painting gave up his L.C.C. appointment. During the summer term of 1910 studied part-time at the Slade and became a friend of Mark Gertler and Augustus John. Left his wife in 1911, and went to Newlyn, Cornwall, in 1912. Exhibited at the N.E.A.C. from 1912; member 1914. Shot himself and his mistress in a fit of jealousy and died a day later in the Chelsea Infirmary 9 October 1914. A romanticized account of the event appears in Gilbert Cannan's novel Mendel 1916.\n\nPublished in:\nMary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London 1964, I\n\n\n\n ", "acquisition": "Presented by Mr and Mrs Julian Lousada through the Art Fund 1925"},

In the following year he produced his first single-panel monochromatic paintings, through which he contributed to the emerging aesthetic of Minimalism. Bringing together the painterly quality of Abstract Expressionism with the intellectual rigours of Minimalism, Marden achieved a balance between emotional intensity and formal simplicity.\nIn his early paintings Marden left a bare narrow margin at the bottom edge of the thickly worked surface of oil mixed with wax to allow the observer to be witness to the process. In later works he developed subtle colour combinations by joining together panels of a single colour in either vertical or horizontal formats. From 1975, when he began making annual visits to Greece, he took inspiration from the light and colour of its landscape and also made reference to mythology in his choice of titles. After preparing designs for stained-glass windows for Basle Cathedral in 1977, he became interested in expressing in his paintings the conditions of colour and light in architecture. \nAfter producing a series of 25 etchings in which he made reference to Chinese ideograms, he introduced a network of meandering lines into his paintings. These works for which monochrome panels now acted as background colour fields, provided a dramatic departure from his previous style, but they continued to stress the importance of touch, surface, colour and tone.\nBibliographyL.

In the early 1850s Boyce drew landscape and architectural subjects with a fluent watercolour technique. In 1854 Boyce made an extended journey to Italy; he painted views of buildings in Venice and Verona, which were commended by Ruskin, and semi-abstract twilight studies, which anticipate Whistler's nocturnes.\nTowards the end of the 1850s Boyce adopted a technique of minute detail and bright colour; various watercolours of this period, are among the most intense and objective of all Pre-Raphaelite landscapes. Boyce abhorred conventional compositions and picturesque detail; he sought viewpoints from which the landscape and buildings might be seen in intriguing conjunction. Boyce ranged England in search of subjects. In the course of a peripatetic career he frequently visited France and Italy, and in 1861\u20132 he travelled to Egypt.\nIn 1868 Boyce commissioned Philip Webb to build a house in Chelsea: West House was completed in 1870, and Boyce lived there until the end of his life. He filled the house with an important collection of paintings; he owned many works by Rossetti, which he had commissioned. \nAs he was of independent means Boyce followed his artistic inclinations without being concerned whether his works would find a ready market. Even if his professional status was uncertain, he was committed to painting and exhibited regularly: at the Royal Academy (1853\u201361) and in 1857 at the exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite pictures held at Russell Place, London.\nBibliographyA.

I found the Keys &amp; the underdeveloped areas the most exciting place I had ever been to. I have visited it both in summer and winter'. In a later conversation, she said that her most recent visit to Florida, from which this painting derived, had been c.1958.2\nThe Keys are a series of islands along the Florida coast and the Everglades a large marshy area of Southern Florida. In a recent interview, the artist explained that she and her husband would reach the Everglades in a borrowed car and then travel through on foot along a network of raised paths or, she said, you 'forced your way through on a punt'.3 She recalled the sense of adventure in visiting the area: 'You can go along a path and there'll be an alligator down there ... it's quite exciting and it's more so when you get more into the woody part.' Ginesi and Coxon had first visited America in 1947 when they were invited by Grace and W. Bryant Mumford, their friends and patrons who had moved from Sussex to New England early in the war. On that occasion they visited the Grand Canyon in Arizona. They made numerous further visits, particularly to New England and Florida. \n\nGinesi employed a range of techniques in the painting of Everglades. Close examination of the work reveals that the oil paint was rubbed into the primed canvas in some areas and applied thickly in others. The watery effects at the bottom have been achieved by applying paint, wiping it off and applying more with a knife. The artist said that these techniques reflected a 'response that you would feel in the Everglades. It's water water everywhere ... it's a mush'.4 She thought it noteworthy that she and her husband had always lived by water, even staying by a lake whilst in New England. The variation of surface gloss reflects the fact that the painting was worked on over a prolonged period of time. \n\nEverglades\nis constructed from a network of interlocking plant forms amid which two herons may be identified. Birds are a common motif in Ginesi's work but these two originated from her memories of the specific place. 'In Florida', she said, 'we just sort of sat up in bed like that and there were heron and things all in the water. It was wonderful, you could just sit quietly there and watch nature playing about'.5 \n\nThe painting's bold colouring falls into two rough areas separated by a diagonal running from the top left to the bottom right hand corner. The bottom left area is largely made up of dark blues and greens, strong purples and cadmium; the upper right half, in contrast, consists largely of ochres, pale blues and pinks. A bold orange area at the point of maximum recession reflects Raymond Coxon's much earlier interpretation of C\u00e9zanne's use of colour. C\u00e9zanne, he wrote in Art: An Introduction to Appreciation\n(1932), 'noticed that warm colours such as yellow and orange could be used to bring forms near, while cool colours such as blue and violet tended to give the impression of recession'.6 \n\nThe 40 x 50 inch format of Everglades\nwas one often employed by Ginesi and Coxon, particularly in their later work. They used standard sized canvases so they could use a single frame to set a newly finished painting apart from its surroundings. A large number of exhibition labels on the frame of Everglades\nrelate to a number of other paintings and reflect this practice. \n\nChris Stephens\nMarch 1996 \n\n1\nLetter to Tate Gallery, 27 Sept. 1964, Tate Gallery catalogue files\n2\nConversation, 29 Sept. 1964, Tate Gallery catalogue files\n3\nInterview with the author, 7 Feb. 1996\n4\nIbid.\n5\nIbid.\n6\nQuoted in Raymond Coxon: Retrospective Exhibition, exh. cat., Stoke-on-Trent City Museum and Art Gallery 1987, p.2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1964", "dimensions": "Support: 1015 x 1270 mm", "reference": "T00688", "title": "Everglades", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ginesi-everglades-t00688", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00688_8.jpg", "artist": "Edna Ginesi", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1902\u20132000", "artistbio": "\n Edna GINESI b.1902Of remote Italian descent, Edna Ginesi was born in Leeds on 15\nFebruary 1902. She studied at Leeds College of Art 1920-1 where she met the artist Raymond Coxon (1896-1997) whom she was to marry in 1926. Both Coxon and Ginesi attended the Royal College of Art in London from 1921 to 1925 where, along with Henry\nMoore, Barbara Hepworth and Vivian Pitchforth, they formed what was known as 'the Leeds table'. During 1923-4 they also attended informal life drawing classes at the studio of Leon Underwood. With the help of a West Riding Travelling Scholarship in\n1924, Ginesi visited Holland, Belgium, Italy and France. She stayed in Paris for several months where she drew at Colorossi's studio every day and visited museums and contemporary art galleries. She and Coxon tried to visit Paris every year after that.\nAfter Ginesi had taught for a year at Bradford School of Art, 1925-6, the Coxons settled in Hammersmith, West London where they were to live for nearly seventy years. Ginesi exhibited with the London Group from 1929, becoming a member in 1933, and had\nher first one-person exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery in 1932. She was a member of the 'Twenties Group', instituted by Lucy Wertheim in 1930. Ginesi worked on a number of theatrical designs, in particular for the Camargo Ballet in 1931-32. During the\n1930s she and Coxon both taught drawing part-time at Chelsea School of Art. In 1938 they bought a studio in Sussex, dividing their time between London and the country from then on. Ginesi was an ambulance driver in London during the war while Coxon\nworked as a war artist and taught in various institutions. Coxon and Ginesi travelled widely and frequently in Britain, Europe and, from 1947, North America. In 1956 Ginesi had a retrospective at Cartwright Hall, Bradford and has since had numerous\nexhibitions in Britain and abroad. Ginesi's work has been dominated by landscape and studies of nature.

He cites a short description of his paintings by Martin Froy, which seems to him to give a just account of what he is trying to do:\n\n'It is a characteristic of Anthony Fry's earlier paintings that, though carried out from the subject with great objectivity, it was the rhythmic and directional movements through the subject in depth which interested him, and his work at this time had an affinity to C\u00e9zanne in its structure rather than to, say Monet. But the particular light in his subject was also important, and hence the mood which was often nostalgic and, in the landscapes, Arcadian.\n\n'The predicament of this kind of painter at the present time is an extraordinarily difficult one. For Anthony Fry the development of the style has been made possible by his belief in a race of young people, whose surfaces, catching the light, sculpture the three dimensional design. He has escaped the ambiguities which would arise if the objects in his picture were not identifiable. More than this the figures have a scarce and touching humanity, at one with the mood of the paintings. It is a very unusual quality and has perhaps attracted more attention than the formal aspect of his work; but it may well be that it is this which is most important to the artist and that the figuration is not inevitable.\u2019\n\nPublished in:\nMary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London 1964, I\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "Exhibited 1957", "dimensions": "Support: 508 x 660 mm", "reference": "T00161", "title": "Dancing Figures", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fry-dancing-figures-t00161", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00161_8.jpg", "artist": "Anthony Fry", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1927", "artistbio": "\n Anthony FRY b. 1927\n\nFigure and landscape painter.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Figure painting was the dominant genre in Corinth's work. He painted himself, his family and friends, as well as models, commissioned portraits and mythological or biblical subjects. He regularly imbued his figures with a sense of drama and psychological depth. In 1911 he suffered partial paralysis as the result of a stroke. This led to dramatic changes in his painting style, and later works, such as this one, have a characteristically agitated and expressionistic brushwork. \n\nThe popular image of St Mary Magdalen conflates three biblical figures. The most significant is Mary of Magdala, whom Christ cleansed of seven demons (Luke 8:2, Mark 16:9), and who accompanied and ministered to Him in Galilee (Luke 8:1-2), witnessed His Crucifixion and burial (all Gospel accounts) and was the first person to see Him resurrected (Mark 16:9-10 &amp; John 20:14-17). The other related figures are Mary of Bethany, who annointed Christ's feet and wiped them with her hair (John 12:3-17); and an unnamed woman who did the same (Luke 7:37-48) and whose sins Christ pardoned as a result. Although there is no biblical authority for the description of Mary Magdalen as a reformed prostitute, the legend has been long-standing, and many artists have seen her as providing an opportunity to display the female body. At times of anxiety about the prevalence of prostitution, she has also been used to symbolise the perceived threat of untamed female sexuality.\n\nCorinth painted Mary Magdalen a number of times but never as dramatically as in this work. Here the figure fills the small canvas from edge to edge, generating a compositional energy and intensity. Areas of light and shadow are strikingly contrasted, and brightly coloured highlights are used to enliven the flesh tones. A sense of movement is generated through the contrasting directions of the Magdalen's pose and the brushstrokes behind. The look on her face and the placement of her splayed hand on her chest suggest a sudden expression of regret or anxiety, and her eyes look swollen, as if from crying. The skull in the lower right hand corner of the painting is a traditional reminder of mortality. Set in direct contrast with the Magdalen's head, it emphasises both the inevitable passing of beauty and the ephemerality of sensual pleasure. The pearls on her wrist and in her hair can also be seen as references to the decadence of her earlier life. \n\nIt is not known exactly where Corinth painted this work but during 1919 he divided his time between his homes in Berlin and Bavaria. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nCharlotte Berend-Corinth, Die Gem\u00e4lde von Lovis Corinth.

He often visits Provence, is very responsive to the light of that region and finds the Proven\u00e7al landscape stimulating to his imagination. 'Provence I' 1957 belongs to a series of paintings associated with Provence which he began in 1957 and proposed to continue in 1958 and the following year. The blue is not intended to represent the blue of the Mediterranean, but instead serves him to transform and recall the total impression of the landscape in Mediterranean light. It is also the throbbing, the vibration of that light. He set out to convey the feeling of being in the landscape and surrounded by it, instead of just being a spectator looking at it. \n\n'The starting-point of my pictures is usually the recollection of an emotion felt in front of nature' (letter of 20 July 1958). \n\nWhen asked by Guy Weelen whether colours had any psychological significance for him, he replied: 'Yes indeed! Instinctively, violence drives me to use red, calm, the heat of mid-day seem to me blue. If I ask myself why blue has this meaning for me, I don't think the answer lies in a reference to the sea, but much more in shadows turning bluish in the great intensity of heat. Blue is for me the rest, the calm, the beatitude of the siesta in the Mediterranean climate ....' (G.

The painting is at present in my possession. Some interesting sketches were made for it, that of the Tate Gallery is the least abstract, the others are more simplified. My intention was in the final picture to divide the canvas into two parts on the diagonal, that with the harlequin treated as flat\nand the other modelled, while preserving, of course, the unity of the composition. \n\n'The figure in the hat, leaning on the one who holds the mask, has disappeared.' \n\nAnother, more finished oil sketch showing a slightly later stage and measuring 81 x 66cm is reproduced in colour in Colour, XI, December 1919, p.90 as 'Homage to Watteau'. The composition is very much the same, though more stylised and monumental; the most conspicuous change is that the harlequin's costume has a very pronounced diamond-shaped pattern of alternating greens and browns. It is not clear whether this was the picture exhibited at the Mansard Gallery in August 1919 as 'Sketch for \"Homage to Watteau\"'; it could well have been shown as no.121, 'Homage to Watteau', with the Tate's picture as no.130, the sketch.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Decorative painting of this kind was intended to be set into panelling above doors and\nchimney pieces, a fashion that was at its height towards the end of the seventeenth century but which continued into the early eighteenth. Such canvases were usually devised as simple, eye-catching compositions. Landscapes, ruins, flowers and fruit were\ncommon subjects. Such pictures were designed, like this one, to be seen from below. Most painters working in this genre in England came from the Netherlands: Griffier trained in Amsterdam and settled as a decorative and landscape painter in London soon\nafter 1666. He was the first of at least three members of his family to settle in Britain. Although he returned to Holland around 1695 and stayed for about a decade, he died at his house at Millbank, Westminster. That he was sufficiently domiciled to\nanglicise his name, as in this case, to 'John', indicates that this painting was executed in England, although it is not known whether it was intended for a specific interior. The unlikely setting and assemblage of birds is typical of the fanciful\nsubject matter of these kinds of paintings. Of the birds represented here, the black kite hovering over the decorative domestic fowl on a formal terrace is the only one then native to Britain; the others are all ornamental varieties introduced from\nabroad. At left are a common turkey and a female domestic fowl with two frightened chicks. On the minuscule pond are a white ornamental duck and an Egyptian goose (a member of the shelduck family) with five ducklings. The male domestic fowl on the\nparapet is probably an ornamental Polish variety, and the parakeet flapping its wings on the urn was probably an introduction from America. The landscape beyond the terrace affords a glimpse of classical buildings and a formal flower-bed laid out around\na circular basin. Further reading:Ellis K.

Walpole says he was first apprenticed to a carpenter,\na tile painter and a flower painter before becoming a pupil of the etcher and landscape painter Roelant Roghman (c.1620-86). According to Walpole he also studied informally with Adriaen van de Velde (1636-72), Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/9-82) and\n(doubtfully) Rembrandt. Griffier moved to London soon after the Great Fire of 1666, which he depicted in several paintings. In London he continued his studies under Jan Looten (1618-81), painting numerous highly finished, small London and Rhineland\nviews 'which he executed with richness and neat colouring, and enlivened with small figures, cattle and buildings' (Walpole 1888, II, p.130). He was admitted a 'free-brother' of the Company of Painter-Stainers in London in 1677, contributing a\nLandscape with Ruins to their hall. An expert etcher, Griffier produced a series of plates of birds after Francis Barlow, as well as a number of mezzotint portraits after Peter Lely and Godfrey Kneller. Walpole states that Griffier had his own\nyacht on the Thames, from which he sketched scenery, and he seems to have travelled widely between the main British cities, including London, Windsor, Oxford and Gloucester, of which he painted views. He returned to Holland around 1695, apparently in\nhis yacht, which was shipwrecked off the Dutch coast; he remained in that country for about ten years before returning to London, where he bought a house at Millbank. He enjoyed the patronage of the Duke of Beaufort. Walpole notes that 'mixed scenes of\nrivers and rich country were his favourite subjects' (Walpole 1888, II, p.131); his prospects of Hampton Court Palace (c.1710, Tate Gallery T00408) and Syon House (c.1710, collection Duke of\nNorthumberland, Syon House) combine real views of the houses with fantastic landscapes. In his later years he widened his subject-matter to include imaginary landscapes with fantastic figures, such as A Turkey and other Fowl in a Park (1710,\nTate Gallery T04129), as well as marine views. Vertue called him 'in his latter part of his time a great mimick of other masters both Italian &amp; flemish. in which succeeded &amp; deceived very well. livd somewhat\nretird towards his latter end &amp; died (at his house on millbank Westminster) of a good old age (72)' (Vertue I, p.51). His son Robert Griffier (1688-c.1750) and grandson Jan Griffier II (fl.1738-73) were also landscape painters. After\nhis death an auction of his pictures took place at Covent Garden, London.Further reading:Horace Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting in England, revised edition, London 1888, II, pp.129-31 'Vertue Note Books I', The\nWalpole Society, XVIII, Oxford 1930, pp.50-1 Ellis K.

Brought to Mexico soon after the Conquest, it added \u201cMatinche\u201d (Cortez' Mistress and Interpreter) as a character, but retained the Spanish El Toro (the bull). It was then brought up into New Mexico where it took on Indian characteristics. The three-pronged stick is still a symbol of its Christian origin. The Trinity Dance is not an Indian Ceremonial, though treated as such in the refusal to have photographs taken of it, or drawings or paintings on the spot.\u2019 She added (10 October 1959): \u2018The ball in the other hand is a rattle, made out of a dried pumpkin, filled with fine stones. The head-dress is made of cardboard in the shape of a Bishop's mitre, the mask is a heavy fringe of silk, attached to the lower border of the head-dress. Lower down a coloured silk handkerchief is tied across the lower part of the face.... I have been all this time trying to find out the meaning of the word Matachinas. Nobody really knows, the only thing we can disentangle is that Mata means Kill and Chinas means Chinese. Therefore the idea is that in Spain it meant kill the Moors, in old Mexico it meant kill the Chinese, probably because they had never heard of the Moors but had heard of the Chinese.\u2019\n\nPublished in:\nMary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin, The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London 1964, I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1948", "dimensions": "Frame: 1388 x 1135 x 70 mm", "reference": "T00284", "title": "Ceremonial Indian Dance: The Matachinas", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/brett-ceremonial-indian-dance-the-matachinas-t00284", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00284_8.jpg", "artist": "The Hon.

He was never a naturally fluid draughtsman, and he never achieved any great dramatic force. In 1871 Walker designed his famous poster for the stage adaptation of Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White. His dramatic image of Anne Catherick, swathed in a cloak and seen full length from behind, is generally considered the first successful modern pictorial poster and anticipates many similar designs of the 1890s. Walker himself believed that the designing of posters could become \u2018a most important branch of art'.\nAs a painter in watercolours and oils Walker began to enjoy success from about 1863 onwards. Walker employed a meticulous and heavily worked gouache technique that owed much to William Henry Hunt and Myles Birket Forster. \nWalker's study of the Antique as a student led him to rely on the formal conventions of antique sculpture in his oil paintings. \nTo Victorian eyes Walker seemed a sincere and unsentimental observer of rustic life. His paintings were considered sensitive portrayals of rural landscape and life. Walker's agreeable character and his early death from tuberculosis sustained his posthumous reputation, and he was an important influence on young British painters working in the 1870s and 1880s. But the idealised and sentimental quality of much of his work engendered subsequent critical neglect. \nBibliographyDNBC. Phillips: Frederick Walker, Port. Monographs A. Subjects, vi (1894)J. G.

Both had worked previously for James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos at his extravagant new mansion, Canons, in Middlesex, where work was probably complete by c.1725.\n\nSleter and Thornhill's work at Grimsthorpe is contained within the impressive east wing of the house, which was extensively remodelled by the great baroque architect, Sir John Vanbrugh (1664-1726), for Peregrine Bertie, 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven (d.1742). Although commissioned as early as 1715, by the 1st Duke, building work did not begin until 1723, after the 1st Duke's death. After Vanbrugh's death in 1726, completion of the wing, which dragged on until 1730, was overseen by Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661-1736). Precisely when within this time framework the painted decoration was executed is not known, although Thornhill was engaged at Moor Park, Hertfordshire in 1725-7, followed by Sleter c.1730-2. \n\nAlthough painted decorative schemes within houses were often used as vehicles for expressing political messages or personal power, the ceilings at Grimsthorpe appear to follow neutral, fairly conventional, themes. Sleter's Triumph of Cybele, representative of Earth and the temporal sphere, contrasts with Thornhill's godly realm, Apollo and the Muses, on the other staircase. The latter's celebration of the arts is picked up again by Sleter in the State Dining Room where Minerva and Mercury preside over the arts and learning. Sleter's oil sketch is obviously a preliminary idea as the finished ceiling (executed on strips of canvas applied to the ceiling, not oil on plaster) in many respects differs substantially. For example, the illusion of a coved ceiling seen here, into which the godly world spills, has disappeared and the composition extends instead into lunettes added at either side. In the sketch Minerva, goddess of wisdom and the arts, and Mercury, identified with reason and learning (he taught Cupid to read), appear at the apex of the composition, surrounded by groupings representative of different aspects of knowledge and the arts. Music occupies the centre with Astronomy and/or Architecture immediately to the right and Sculpture and Painting below. The female figure on the far right, holding aloft a shining star, a rapt scholar at her feet, appears on the actual ceiling seated on the left with a winged figure, possibly History, beside her, while the star's brilliant shaft of light (divine revelation) falls onto an open book.\n\nSleter is first recorded in England in 1719 but his work at Grimsthorpe is possibly his earliest to survive in this country. Unlike other Venetian decorative artists working there, who pursued itinerant, international careers, Sleter remained in England until his death in 1775, aged ninety. He was buried at Mereworth, Kent.\n\nFurther reading:Edward Croft Murray, Decorative Painting in England 1537-1837, II, 1970, pp.277-8Elizabeth Einberg and Judy Egerton, The Age of Hogarth: British Painters born before 1675-1709, Tate Gallery Catalogues of the Permanent Collection, II, 1988, pp.212-3 \n\nTabitha BarberApril 2001 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1724", "dimensions": "Support: 613 x 762 mm", "reference": "T03465", "title": "A Representation of the Liberal Arts: Ceiling Design for the State Dining Room at Grimsthorpe Castle", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/sleter-a-representation-of-the-liberal-arts-ceiling-design-for-the-state-dining-room-at-t03465", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03465_8.jpg", "artist": "Francesco Sleter", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1685\u20131775", "artistbio": "\n FRANCESCO SLETER 1685\u20131775\n\nDecorative and history painter, said to be a Venetian by birth.

In the Autumn of that year, he went to a small college in rural western Pennsylvania, and while he was there (in the role of Visiting Artist) he painted about a dozen really strong paintings. Upon returning to New York, and during early 1965, the Time Paintings were made.\n\nIn the summer of 1965, Larry used the gallery as his studio ...

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nColumn Structure II is a tall orange-coloured acrylic and charcoal painting made from six square canvas panels. Five of these canvases are joined together from top to bottom to form a narrow, vertical rectangle, while the sixth is connected to the left side of the second canvas from the top. It is unclear whether the canvases are actually joined together or just arranged together when hung. The orange surface of the painting has three curvaceous lines and a rectilinear grid pattern drawn onto it in black charcoal. Two of the curved lines run in parallel very close together, forming an arc that stretches from the bottom-centre of the painting up to the right edge of the vertical column, then over to the left side, terminating at the top left corner of the protruding canvas square. The third curved line resembles a sine wave and runs from the bottom right corner of the painting to the centre of its top edge, reaching first the left and then the right edges of the canvas as it moves up the painting. These lines intersect with the much lighter marks of the grid pattern at certain points, such as at the peaks and mid-points of the arcs and in one of the places where all of the curves meet. The paint has a relatively matt surface appearance and is in a single orange hue, although some subtle tonal variations are visible.\nThis work was made by the American artist Robert Mangold in New York in 2006. The curved lines were plotted out by Mangold on a smaller canvas before he drew them onto the final work in charcoal. They were drawn onto the unpainted canvases by hand, without any mechanical aids, but Mangold first pencilled on the grid pattern to facilitate this process. While most of the drawing was executed with the canvases laid horizontally, Mangold eventually placed the work vertically in order to inspect his lines. Once he had drawn the curves he painted each of the sections outlined by the grid separately, applying acrylic in several thin coats using a roller before retracing the curves to make them darker and stronger. The grid lines are less clearly visible because they sit below the surface of the paint. Mangold stated in 2009 that he used a roller to apply the acrylic paint because he \u2018didn\u2019t want to get into the kind of surface incident that comes with a brush\u2019 (Mangold in John Yau, \u2018Robert Mangold in Conversation with John Yau\u2019, Brooklyn Rail, 6 March 2009, http://www.brooklynrail.org/2009/03/art/in-conversation-robert-mangold-with-john-yau, accessed 10 October 2014). Discussing earlier paintings that he made using the same drawing technique, Mangold said in 2005 that when working in this way he wanted to make the curves as \u2018smooth and clean\u2019 as possible, but that where they crossed each other they often seemed to \u2018bulge\u2019, so he paid particular attention to the effect of smoothness in these areas (Mangold in Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay 2005, p.38).\nThis painting is one of a series of twelve works, called Column Structure Paintings, which Mangold produced in 2006. Between 2002 and 2004 Mangold had made a related series entitled Column Paintings. As with the Column Structure Paintings, the works in this earlier series are very tall and feature grids and wave-like lines, yet they are all rectangular in format whereas each of the Column Structure Paintings were made on supports combined to form various different shapes. While the term \u2018structure\u2019 seems to make reference to Mangold\u2019s concern with the overall shape of the paintings, the word \u2018column\u2019 evokes a connection with architecture, which is also suggested by the very long and thin format of this painting. Mangold became well known in the mid-1960s for his Walls and Areas series, such as Red Wall 1964 (Tate T13700), which also had a relationship to the built environment, and the curator Marla Prather has noted of the Column Paintings series that these were his \u2018first works since the masonite \u201cWalls\u201d of the 1960s that have clear architectural implications not only by way of their titles but by their form\u2019 (Marla Prather, \u2018A Curious Linkage with the Past\u2019, in Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay 2005, p.19).\nMangold has noted that all of the works in the Column Paintings series make \u2018an implied suggestion ... that [the curved lines] could continue through the top or bottom of the work, ascending or descending, but they are confined by the column\u2019s sides\u2019 (Mangold in Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay 2005, pp.39\u201340). This is equally true of the Column Structure Paintings: in Column Structure II, this combination of confinement and flowing continuity can be seen in the relationship between its rectilinear grid structure and its rounded arcs. As Mangold has observed, although the bending lines in these works have a flowing, dynamic quality, the grid also \u2018allows you to see the regularity of the repeated curve. It became a kind of stabilising structure for these curving lines\u2019 (Mangold in Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay 2005, p.37).\n\nFurther reading\n\nCorrespondances: Robert Mangold, Paul Gauguin, exhibition catalogue, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris 2005, pp.18\u201321, 37\u201340.\nRobert Mangold: Column Structure Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Pace Wildenstein, New York 2007, reproduced p.23.\nDavid HodgeOctober 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint and charcoal on canvas", "date": "2006", "dimensions": "Support: 3048 x 1223 x 42 mm", "reference": "T12267", "title": "Column Structure II", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/mangold-column-structure-ii-t12267", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12267_8.jpg", "artist": "Robert Mangold", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1937", "artistbio": "\n Robert Mangold born 1937American painter and lithographer of a Minimal tendency,\nconcerned with shape and anonymous, single-colour surfaces.

The castle is famous as the birthplace of William the Conqueror. \n\nMme Friesz says that Othon Friesz spent two years at Falaise when he was very young, probably just after his military service. At that period he was very poor and spent a great part of his time at Falaise in an old house which he called 'Les Hautes Folies'.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Robin Guthrie entered the Slade School of Art in 1918 with the financial assistance of his patron, the collector Jakob de Graaf. His skilful draughtsmanship brought him to the attention of Henry Tonks (1862-1937), the school's principal, and in the summer of 1920 his painting Pastoral Scene with Figures (Slade School Collection) won first prize for composition. Guthrie completed his studies in the summer of 1922 and took a studio in a church hall on Parkhill Road, Hampstead, London, with his fellow student and friend Rodney Burn (1899-1984). Sermon on the Mount was painted during these months, either just before he left the Slade or just after. Although the depiction of religious and mythological subjects was encouraged at the Slade, Sermon on the Mount should be considered in relation to Jacob Epstein's Risen Christ 1919 (Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) and within the wider proliferation of such imagery after the First World War (1914-8). \n\nThe subject of the painting is Christ's sermon to the faithful, as recounted in chapters five to seven of St Matthew's Gospel. Having been among the crowds, where He had healed the sick, Christ withdrew with His followers to a mountain near the Sea of Galilee, shown in the background. The sermon He gave expounds the central ethics of Christianity and represents a development of the Mosaic Law, which had been passed down by God at Mount Sinai to the Israelites. In the painting there seem to be several references to events leading upto the sermon and to the text of the sermon itself. The girl holding her crutches and the man unwrapping his bandages represent the sick he had healed before going up to the mount; the house on the beach and the one on top of the hill may represent the parable of the builders,\n\nTherefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the flood came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods came and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it' (St Matthew, chapter 7, verses 24-7)\n\nIn the painting, all the figures,except Christ, wear contemporary clothing, perhaps indicating the continued relevance of Christianity to the modern world, particularly in the aftermath of the First World War (1914-18). In this context, the olive tree, in the centre of the picture, may be read as a symbol of peace. \n\nThe figure of Christ is almost certainly a self portrait and the seated figure underneath the tree is probably the artist Thomas Monnington (1902-76), a contemporary at the Slade. As yet the other figures in the painting have not been identified, though it seems likely that they were friends or colleagues of Guthrie's.\n\nFurther reading:A Centenary Exhibition: The Slade 1871-1971, exhibition catalogue, Royal Academy of Arts, London 1971\n\nToby TrevesSeptember 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1922", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 2450 x 1840 mm", "reference": "T06770", "title": "Sermon on the Mount", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guthrie-sermon-on-the-mount-t06770", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06770_8.jpg", "artist": "Robin Guthrie", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1902\u20131971", "artistbio": "\n Robin GUTHRIE b. 1902\n\nPortrait, genre and landscape painter, mural decorator, illustrator and draughtsman.

He studied at the National Gallery Art School in Melbourne. His earliest paintings and drawings were nearly all studio-based compositions, including portraits, nudes and figure compositions.\nFrom 1952 to 1957 Williams studied in London. He painted, drew and etched the street-life of London. Williams became very familiar with modern and contemporary art. When Williams returned to Australia in 1957 landscape became his main subject.\nWilliams largely shed his Parisian influence in series of works on the forest theme, pursuing a dense and monumental image of the bush through a variety of media. In 1962 he began to visit the You Yangs, a group of rocky hills near Melbourne, producing the You Yangs series (1963\u20134; e.g. You Yangs II, Canberra, N.G.), which established his reputation in Australia. He produced gouache sketches working directly from nature, then worked these up in oil in the studio through series of oil studies, frequently also producing etchings.\nIn the 1970s Williams both painted further afield and enlarged his range of subject-matter, becoming particularly interested in marine subjects. His working method and palette also changed. He chose to paint dramatic landscapes instead of the bleak landscapes of the bush. \nIn the last eight years of his career, Williams produced more landscape series with strong themes, his last being the Pilbara series (1979\u201381), which remained intact as a series as it was acquired by Con-Zinc Rio Tinto Australia, the Melbourne mining company that had invited him to explore the north-west region of Australia.BibliographyJ.

He later collected Impressionist pictures and published essays on Manet and Degas.

He therefore preferred to exhibit the different examples of the same system in the same format. He made in 1956 a work with the same system, but with shorter lines at a different angle and in a format 80 x 80cm on wood. Then in 1960 he made a whole series in this format 80 x 80cm on wood. \n\nThis particular painting was originally executed in black and white. But the strength of the black lines seemed to him too harsh and a year later he covered the surface with a thin coat of white. This made the lines appear grey-blue. \n\nHis usual practice is to superimpose lines of identical length, but in this painting he for the first and last time superimposed two sets of lines of slightly different length. The superimposition was made without attempting to centralise or balance out the composition. \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, p.541, reproduced p.541\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1955\u20136", "dimensions": "Support: 1000 x 1000 mm", "reference": "T01840", "title": "Two Warps and Wefts of Short Lines 0\u00b0 90\u00b0", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/morellet-two-warps-and-wefts-of-short-lines-0-90-t01840", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01840_8.jpg", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Morellet", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1926", "artistbio": "\n Fran\u00e7ois Morellet born 1926French abstract painter and sculptor.

He began to paint in oils at the age of 14. In the late 1750s he returned to Exeter and set up as a drawing-master. \nBy the 1770s Towne was firmly established in Exeter as a painter of landscapes and country houses.\nIn autumn 1780 Towne travelled to Rome via Geneva. The clarity of his watercolour style was especially suited to depictions of Roman architecture. He made many watercolours out of doors, carefully noting time and light conditions, and these became the basis for studio repetitions. Towne's response to Sublime landscape is apparent in bold watercolours such as the Vale of St John Looking towards Keswick (Leeds, C.A.G.). His appreciation of nature on a more intimate scale can be seen in his studies of trees, delineating the intricacy of branches dappled in sunlight, as in the Fir Tree (priv. col).\nHe moved to London, marrying Jeannette Hilligsberg, a dancer, but she died the following year. In 1809 he toured Devon and Cornwall. A frugal man, Towne left nearly \u00a33,000 at his death and bequeathed three albums of his Italian watercolours to the British Museum. Towne created a powerful and idiosyncratic style but, as a Devon-based painter, he had little influence on the London artistic mainstream and was largely forgotten until rediscovered by A. P.

Maps, specifically those of Northern Ireland that show the six counties of Ulster created by the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, became recurring motifs in her paintings, used as a basis on which to explore both political and symbolic representation; cartographic methods of geometric projection are often employed in her work. Hamilton's influence became apparent in her use of collage and oil paint in her works of the 1970s. Early in the following decade she began to deal with more specific elements of Northern Irish culture. In the early 1990s she returned to the human figure with the self-portrait Slade (oil on canvas, 1.52\u00d72.28 m, 1994; artist's priv. col., see 1994 exh. cat., p. 31). She continued her political engagement with Downing Street Declaration, 15 Dec, 1993 (laser prints and gouache on acrylic sheet, 1994; priv. col., see 1994 exh. cat., p. 32).. Like much of her previous art, this work focuses on the way such events are mediated in the press and consumed in the public sphere.\nBibliographyRita Donagh: Paintings and Drawings (exh. cat., ed.

He studied at the Chelsea School of Art, London, from 1946 to 1950. His concern from 1954 was not with the production of art objects as an end in itself but with various processes and consequently with the recording in three dimensions of sequences of events and of patterns of knowledge. In 1958 he introduced torn, overpainted and partly burnt books into assemblages. The destruction and parody of systems of knowledge implied in Latham's work was apparent in 1966, when he organised a party at which guests chewed pages of Clement Greenberg's book Art and Culture; the remains were then fermented into mash, distilled and returned in a test-tube to the St Martin's School of Art library.\nLatham's art and theory were consistently experimental from the late 1950s, including investigations into conceptual art and performance art as well as paintings, assemblages, films and videos. His concept of Event-Structures, which was central to his theories, represents a complex proposition suggesting the realignment of social, economic, political and aesthetic structures around a \u2018time-base' mode of thinking progressing from what Latham termed the \u2018least-event', to complex social and political structures in which a critical role is played by the artist, Latham's \u2018Incidental Person'. In 1966, with his wife Barbara Stevini, Latham created the Artist Placement Group, a sociological and aesthetic programme for placing artists in positions within industry, science and government so that they might generate alternatives to divisive systems of power.\nBibliographyJohn Latham: State of Mind (exh. cat. by J.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nCASTLE CCCXXXIII 15.7.01 2001 is from a loose series of works, designated by the generic title Castle, which occupied Law during the last decade of his life. The ziggurat compositional format of this work is characteristic of this series; a band of red stretches across the lower third of the painting, centred on top of which is a band of yellow, the same width as the red band, its length being half that of the red band, and on top of this is a thin column of dark blue, again the same width as the other two bands but one fifteenth of the length of the red band. In other paintings and drawings, the colours change (or no colour is used) and the size, relationship and positioning of the bands also change. The artist David Batchelor has observed:\n\nThere is a system, but the work is not systematic \u2026 The basic three-part motif is stretched and pulled, squeezed, squashed or fattened up; there is no true or ideal form from which any of the examples could be said to develop or deviate. Each work is a provisional solution. It exists only for the day, and is dated and numbered accordingly. Beyond that, nothing is fixed.\n(Newlyn Art Gallery 1999, p.7.)\n\nBatchelor has suggested that the origins of this late group of works can be found in Law\u2019s early Field drawings (for example Landscape VIII 1959, Tate T13318), especially\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if the forms are read as flat areas rather than three-dimensional structures. Although this may be so \u2013 Law\u2019s formal vocabulary being quite narrow and restrained \u2013 he has also made stacked sculptures that echo the ziggurat form of these paintings. The dynamic between the two readings forms part of the work. The contrast between a built structure and an area that is schematised as a field, between the two-dimensional and the suggestion of the three-dimensional, is also echoed in Law\u2019s work by the interplay between the idea and the materiality of presence (or absence). The numbering of the painting and the inscription of a date signifies the passage of time but also holds special fascination for the artist in the magical pattern of numbers. The number \u2018CCCXXXIII\u2019 does not indicate that this is the three hundred and thirty third painting in the series, but carries different significance. The three-step ziggurat form is, for instance, echoed in a number that is itself split into threes. In some paintings and drawings the inscribed date also reflects such numerology or just the particular attractiveness of a number to Law, in other works it does indeed indicate the actual date the work was made. The ziggurat form can be read as a structure, but it can also refer to a complex philosophical idea. Art historian Anna Lovatt has elaborated this point:\n\nWhile the Castle works can be interpreted iconographically as citadels, the entire series can also be read structurally, as the obsessive elaboration and fortification of a central idea. In a brief statement accompanying the series, Law explained that \u2018the idea of castle seems to suggest that something in the middle needs protecting \u2013 the ring around the original thought\u2019 \u2026 The bureaucratic numbering and dating of the Castle series, and its serial permutations of colour and shape, constitute a conceptual system that is both infinitely productive and endlessly self-reflexive.\n(Anna Lovatt in Saltoun and Schubert 2010, p.21.)\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nBob Law: Paintings and Drawings 1959\u201378, exhibition catalogue, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 1978.\nBob Law, Drawings, Sculpture and Paintings, exhibition catalogue, Newlyn Art Gallery 1999.Richard Saltoun and Karsten Schubert (eds.), Bob Law, A Retrospective, London 2010.\nAndrew WilsonApril 2010\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "2001", "dimensions": "Support: 722 x 1026 mm", "reference": "T13317", "title": "CASTLE CCCXXXIII 15.7.01", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/law-castle-cccxxxiii-15701-t13317", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T13/T13317_8.jpg", "artist": "Bob Law", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1934\u20132004", "artistbio": "\n English painter and sculptor. He was taught drawing and watercolour painting as a child by his maternal grandmother but otherwise received no formal artistic training. In 1957 he moved to St Ives, Cornwall, where he painted and made pots. In 1959 he made his first \u2018field' images (see 1978 exh. cat., figs B, C and D), mystically minimalist records of his response to the natural environment, which set the pattern for all his subsequent work. Between 1961 and 1964 he extended these into Metaphysical Field Paintings (see 1978 exh. cat., fig. L) incorporating hieroglyphic symbols. The paintings of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman were to prove a particular inspiration to him, as was his exploration of both Eastern and Western philosophy, psychology, palaeontology, poetry and alchemy. In the mid 1960s he instituted a long series of \u2018black' paintings, which were his best-known contribution to Minimalism. Although they might at first appear to be dark monochromes, they in fact consist of a subtle layering of different colours in a particular sequence as indicated in titles such as No. 88 Black Black Blue Violet (1974; Amsterdam, Stedel. Mus.). From 1978 he concentrated primarily on sculpture, with which he had experimented briefly in the early 1960s.\nBibliographyBob Law: 10 Black Paintings, 1965\u201370 (exh. cat., Oxford, MOMA, 1974) [interview with Richard Cork]Bob Law: Paintings &amp; Drawings, 1959\u201378 (exh. cat. by S.

His plein air oil sketches, of which this is a striking example, are usually dated to the beginning of his career, around 1810, but firm evidence on the dating is lacking.Between\n1802 and 1808 De Wint was apprenticed to the portrait painter and mezzotint engraver John Raphael Smith. Smith would take him on fishing expeditions by the Thames, during which De Wint would sketch in oils. De Wint gained an early release from his\napprenticeship on condition that he paint eighteen landscapes of various sizes for Smith over a two year period. The river depicted in this study has not been identified but could well be the Thames.Further reading:Hammond Smith,\nPeter De Wint 1784-1849, London 1982, pp.62-70Terry RiggsOctober 1997\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on paper mounted onto cardboard", "date": "?c.1810", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 307 x 460 mm", "reference": "T07242", "title": "River Scene at Sunset", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/de-wint-river-scene-at-sunset-t07242", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07242_8.jpg", "artist": "Peter De Wint", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1784\u20131849", "artistbio": "\n De Wint was born at Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, the son of a physician of Dutch ancestry who had come to\nEngland from New York. He moved to London in 1802, and was apprenticed to John Raphael Smith, the mezzotint engraver and portrait painter. He bought his freedom from Smith in 1806, on condition that he supply eighteen oil paintings over the following\ntwo years. In 1806 he visited Lincoln for the first time, with the painter of historical subjects William Hilton, whose sister Harriet he married in 1810. De Wint and Hilton lived together in Broad Street, Golden Square, where John Varley also lived.\nVarley gave De Wint further lessons and introduced him to Dr Monro, who ran an informal academy for young artists.De Wint first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1807, and the following year at the Gallery of Associated Artists in Watercolours. He\nentered the Royal Academy Schools in 1809. He was elected an Associate of the Old Watercolour Society in 1810 and was made a full member the following year. By that time, as an established drawing-master, he was spending his summers teaching well-to-do\nprovincial families. He frequently visited his wife's home city of Lincoln, and many of his panoramic landscapes and haymaking scenes are set in Lincolnshire. He occasionally toured in Wales, and in 1828 travelled to Normandy.

At 15, Freedman's talent for drawing led to jobs as a draughtsman for a monumental mason, then for an architect. After five years' evening study at St Martin's School of Art, London, he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art (1922\u20135), where he later became a teacher himself. As a painter, Freedman was neither reactionary nor avant-garde; traditional subject-matter, in a subdued but contemplative manner, gave little hint of his ebullient personality. He is remembered chiefly as a pioneer of colour autolithography for machine production at the Curwen and Baynard presses, which he achieved by transferring drawings on stone to offset plates. Freedman autolithographed some 40 book jackets and numerous posters and played a leading role in the production of large-scale colour prints for Contemporary Lithographs (1937), Lyons (1947, 1951, 1955) and Guinness (1956). He staged plays, designed the Silver Jubilee stamp in 1935 and tackled ephemera with consummate professionalism. An official war artist, first with the British Expeditionary Force in France, then with the Admiralty until 1946, Freedman won the CBE for his work. This included large-scale paintings, portraits of entire ships' crews and the notable lithograph 15-inch Gun Turret in HMS Repulse. After the war, he became a rumbustious TV and radio personality.\nBibliographyManchester, Met. U., All Saints Lib. [archive of letters and ephemera]PAT GILMOUR\n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1939"},

Under the terms of the Award the head of an art gallery or museum was invited each year to act as adjudicator, and the prizewinning work was then presented to his gallery 'as a permanent gift and example of Canadian art'.\n\nThe artist wrote (7 January 1977) that the 42 paintings in this series known as 'Polar' were all central image works, that is to say the shapes did not relate to the framed edge in any direct way. (This bothered him after a while, so he started working with only two or three shapes connected to the canvas edges in order to describe the empty spaces between). The word polar relates to the central image character of these works and not to the north pole or north magnetic pole which he was not to visit until 1974, though he probably also had the north in mind at the time. There was no direct connection with landscape, except that he was working then with what one could call landscape space.\n\nHe first started using collage about 1958 in Mexico. He had been making a series of landscapes which had become very stylised, with repetitive shapes. In frustration he tore the papers into small pieces. He was working at that time in the winter palace of the Duke of Canal, using the dining-room as his studio. The floor was covered with odd shapes where they fell. Combinations started to emerge as he studied them. Picking them up gingerly he pinned them to a board, and before he was fully aware of what he was doing he had created a painting containing shapes and spaces 'that would have broken my arm to draw the day before.' This became his method of working until 1963.\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.574-5, reproduced p.574\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint and paper on canvas", "date": "1961", "dimensions": "Support: 1172 x 1397 mm", "reference": "T00562", "title": "Polar No. 1", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/onley-polar-no-1-t00562", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00562_8.jpg", "artist": "Toni Onley", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1928", "artistbio": "\n Toni Onley born 1928Canadian painter in oils, watercolour and collage, etcher and\nlithographer.

Archer, introduction to exh. catalogue Avinash Chandra, Hamilton Galleries, London, March 1965, n.p., repr.; Chandra material in the India Office Library, London\n\nIn his introduction to the Commonwealth Institute exhibition, W.G. Archer relates Chandra's work to the symbolic poems found in earlier Indian art and poetry: 'In Avinash Chandra's work sexual images play a vital role, but it is important to realise that they are almost always introduced as part of a much larger experience and in a wider context. They are symbols of exuberance, resilience, toughness and delight and part of their appeal lies in their constant blending with other poetic images: spires, trees, flowers, orchards, hills, moons and stars.' He developed the theme further in his introduction to the Hamilton Galleries exhibition (loc. cit.): 'During the making of the Monitor film on his work by BBC Television, Chandra began to introduce the female nude more boldly into his painting. He reverted, in other words, not only to traditional Indian attitudes but to a subject which accounts for some of the greatest Indian sculpture. He developed a more indolent and sumptuous line and while continuing to show great heads packed with teeming reveries, he began to delve into the body with almost surgical zest. At the same time he retained his Indian sense of men and women as part of Nature and of landscapes as human lovers. \"Hills of Gold\" is a blend of all these concepts. A giant nude, caressed by an invisible lover, is at the same time a red hill assailed by gusts of wind or banks of cloud. The nude has the solemn majesty of a long down; the hill something of the sultry glamour of a brooding enchantress.'\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, p.117\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1964", "dimensions": "Support: 1016 x 2413 mm", "reference": "T00724", "title": "Hills of Gold", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/chandra-hills-of-gold-t00724", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00724_8.jpg", "artist": "Avinash Chandra", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1931\u20131991", "artistbio": "\n Avinash Chandra born 1931 [- 1991]Indian painter, born in Simla.

He confirmed in 1982 that its definitive title should be \u2018By the Lake\u2019, under which it was first exhibited. He closely associated it with \u2018The Christening\u2019 1921 which, like \u2018By the Lake\u2019, was bought, soon after completion, by Augustus Daniel and given by Daniel's widow to Burn. \u2018The Christening\u2019 was later sold from Burn's Zaydler Gallery exhibition to a buyer who has not been traced.\n\nBoth works were painted when Burn was a student at the Slade School. They were of the same size, chosen by Burn because it was the most customary for the Slade Competition, for which both were entered. In both works the figures included the artist's sister Peggy, Thomas Monnington (with whom Burn shared a studio at the time) and others derived from models. Like \u2018By the Lake\u2019, \u2018The Christening\u2019 represents a group in the open air, included in which are a mother (Burn's sister) and baby, a clergyman and godparents, and a man (Monnington) fishing beside a stream; a church is seen in the distance.\n\nIn accordance with the teaching of the time at the Slade, both pictures were developed from drawings of their various components, nearly all done from nature, and now dispersed. Burn worked on \u2018By the Lake\u2019 for at least two months (including the drawings). The background studies were made at Aldenham Reservoir, which was near his home at Potters Bar. The shadowystanding figure at the extreme left was invented, but the other nine foreground figures were derived as follows, reading from left to right. The seated woman (the only other figure not developed from a drawing from life) was based on a picture postcard of a fat freak who was an exhibit at Barnet Fair; although she wore a hat in the postcard, Burn invented the one she wears in his picture. The man standing behind her holding an oar is the artist's father, Sir Joseph Burn KBE, one-time President of the Prudential Insurance Company. The standing lady with her back towards the viewer was the sculptor Dorothy Sharwood-Smith, who Burn was to marry in 1923 and who was at that time a student at the Slade. Burn tried to accentuate the ugliness of the fat lady to her left, so as to stress by contrast the beauty of this figure. With the shadowy figure at extreme left the fat lady was intended to form a slightly sinister corner. The man standing next to Dorothy Sharwood-Smith is Thomas Monnington, a fellow Slade student and later President of the Royal Academy. He was too young to serve in the First World War, but is here wearing the soldier's peaked hat which had belonged to Burn during his War service. The next three figures were all derived from artists' models. The youth holding two oars was Burn's younger brother Maurice, then a schoolboy, and the lady at far right was Burn's sister Peggy, later Mrs Barrowman.\n\nA strong influence on this picture was Watteau, in particular his crowded semi-outdoor figure painting \u2018Les Plaisirs du Bal\u2019 (\u2018Le Bal Champ\u00eatre\u2019) in the Dulwich Picture Gallery, which Burn viewed often. He aimed to establish a sense of communication across the picture between the different figures, especially between the man in the army hat and the girl seated on the ground. The strongest influence from living artists was that of the Slade Professor, Tonks; Burn felt this is specially apparent in the way the heads are painted. Tonks's teaching was clear and insistent, and was particularly concentrated in the case of any student, such as Burn, who he felt showed special promise. Another Slade teacher, Steer, was also an influence. Burn was struck by Steer's apparent inability to make an unpleasant mark, but found Steer much less forceful as a teacher than Tonks. He considered Steer most effective when a student managed to persuade him to demonstrate technique (as when Steer resolved some difficulties in the painting of the sky in Burn's large lunette, \u2018Waterlow Park\u2019 1922).\n\nScenes where land meets water remained a persistent preoccupation of Burn's, but in later years he tended to do fewer paintings including figures, both because the demand for landscapes was greater and because models became more difficult to obtain.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1984\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1922", "dimensions": "Support: 917 x 1222 mm", "reference": "T03214", "title": "By the Lake", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burn-by-the-lake-t03214", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03214_8.jpg", "artist": "Rodney J.

The larger part appears to have been worked with a brush, though a knife has been used to apply an appropriate texture to areas like the roof of the buildings, the top of the hill and the ploughed furrows on the right-hand side. The artist seems to have used the handle of a brush or similar point to achieve the texture of the edge of the roof and the grassy fringe at the foot of the hill.\n\nThe artist told the Tate Gallery that she thought the painting was executed in 1934 before the birth of her daughter Jan in August 1935.[1]\nThe snow on the top of the hill in the picture and the leafless state of the olive trees would suggest that the painting was executed in the winter of 1934-35. Jan Fordham has speculated that the location might be in the vicinity of St Remy de Provence, one of Mackinnon\u2019s favourite places.[2]\nA local resident has suggested that the farm may be the Mas de la Dame on the southern side of Les Alpilles range of hills, about ten miles south of St Remy.[3]\nThough extensive additions to the Mas de la Dame c.1938/9 make it impossible to identify it unequivocally with the farm in the picture, M. Chormi, observing that in the 1930s there were few buildings of that size in the area, believed the relationship between the building and the hills was the same as in the painting.\n\nMiss Fordham also stated that Mackinnon always worked on the spot, taking between a week and ten days to complete an oil painting.[4]\nThe artist did not make preparatory drawings but usually roughed out the main forms on the canvas in pencil or charcoal; the paint is too thick and its coverage too complete to confirm that this is the case in Farm Buildings in Provence. The scene is painted with bold and bright colours - an almost cerulean sky and orange/brown earth - and the suggestion of a stark light. This may reflect the conditions in which the painting was executed. It also exemplifies a quality typical of her work: a sharpened naturalism and the use of acidic colours which derive from the artist\u2019s mood as much as from her subject. Small holes in all four corners and a circular abrasion around the hole, top left, indicate that the canvas was pinned up after completion.\n\nIn a review of the exhibition from which this painting was purchased in 1940, a critic commented upon the lack of human beings in Mackinnon\u2019s pictures, which he compared to \u2018the ghostly quality of Christopher Wood\u2019s lovely seashores\u2019.[5]\nIn 1940 Farm Buildings in Provence was recommended for the Tate Gallery by the painter Allan Gwynne-Jones, who had been a fellow student at the Slade School with Mackinnon and had painted her portrait in 1922 - Portrait of an Art Student, c.1922.[6]\n\nChris Stephens\nFeb. 1998\n[1]\nLetter to Tate Gallery, 26 June [1953]\n[2]\nJan Fordham, letter to Tate Gallery, 26 Feb. 1996\n[3]\nAndr\u00e9 Chormi, telephone conversation with the compiler, 8 May 1996\n[4]\nJan Fordham, letter to Tate Gallery, 26 Feb. 1996\n[5]\nThomas McGreavy, \u2018In the World\u2019s Art Centres\u2019, Studio, vol.120, July 1940, p.22-3\n[6]\nRepr.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This painting by the early sporting artist James Seymour is one of the artist's most\nsympathetic portraits. The sitter is depicted with a hound in a hunting field. An old label on the verso reads 'Paternal Ancestor (Russell)'; however, no precise identification of the sitter has been made. Given Seymour's associations with Newmarket,\nit is possible that the sitter may be a junior member of the family of Admiral Russell (created Baron Shingay and Earl of Orford for his victory over the Dutch at La Hogue; died 1729). Admiral Russell acquired the manor of Chippenham Park, just outside\nNewmarket. Seymour was passionate about racing and is believed to have owned racehorses himself.The detailing of the costume, such as the firmly-tied breeches-lacings and the buttoned leather strap above the knee to keep the breeches from riding up,\nis painted with the artist's customary meticulousness. His very precise records of the animals, clothing, equipment and locale exactly fulfilled his patrons' requirements.Further reading:Judy Egerton, British Sporting and\nAnimal Paintings 1655-1867, London (and New Haven?) 1978, p.45, no.48, reproduced pl.17Tate Gallery 1978-80 Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1981, p.41, reproducedTerry RiggsMarch 1998\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1740", "dimensions": "Support: 876 x 1108 mm", "reference": "T02372", "title": "Mr Russell on his Bay Hunter", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/seymour-mr-russell-on-his-bay-hunter-t02372", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T02/T02372_8.jpg", "artist": "James Seymour", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " ?1702\u20131752", "artistbio": "\n The early sporting artist James Seymour was born in London, the son of James Seymour Sr, a wealthy banker,\ngoldsmith, diamond merchant and amateur artist who supplied the plate for racing trophies. The elder Seymour traded at the sign of the Flower-de-Luce in Mitre Court, Fleet Street, and was a member, with John Wootton, of the Virtuosi Club of St Luke, a\ngentlemen's club for artists and art lovers. Through his father, the young Seymour was introduced to the leading artists of the day. Although he had no formal art training, he learnt to draw by studying pictures and prints in his father's collection.\nHis drawings of horses heads after Tempesta and Van Dyck are in British Museum. The contemporary diarist of the art world George Vertue set out Seymour's career as follows:\t\tJimmy Seymor ... from his infancy had a genius to drawing of\nHorses ( this he pursued \twith great Spirit. set out with all sorts ... The darling of his Father run thro some \tthousands - livd gay high and loosely - horse raceing gameing women &amp;c. country \thouses. never studied \tenough to colour or paint well. but\nhis necessityes - obliged him. to \twork or starve. thus his time passd. the latter part of his life in baseness and want of all \tnecessaries. and dyed in Town. in the lowest circumstances &amp; in debt - Southwark June - \t1752. aged about or under\n50.\t\t\t\t('Vertue Note Books III', Walpole Society, vol.22, 1934, p.86)Seymour seems also to have bankrupted his father. Passionate about racing, he is believed to have owned racehorses himself. His earliest signed and dated\nracehorse painting is from 1721, from which time his output was prolific, indicating that he must have established a reputation professionally. Some of his racing and hunting scenes were engraved in the 1740s and 1750s. He counted among his patrons Sir\nWilliam Jolliffe, MP, and the 6th Duke of Somerset, who commissioned him to decorate a room at Petworth with portraits of racehorses. The room decoration was never completed due to a quarrel between the artist and his patron. One of the first true\nsporting artists in Britain, he had no other subject matter, unlike John Wootton and George Stubbs. Seymour's obituary referred to him as 'particularly eminent in horse-painting' (Gentleman's Magazine, vol.22, London 1752,\np.336).Further reading:Walter Shaw Sparrow, British Sporting Artists from Barlow to Herring, London and New York 1922'Vertue Note Books III', Walpole Society, vol.22, Oxford 1934, p.86Stella A.

He was essentially self-taught and turned to painting in his mid-thirties after abandoning a career in advertising. His work of the 1960s was boldly geometric, relying on primary colours and on optical effects; during this period he also produced outdoor installations and colour walls of art environment proportions. In the 1970s his paintings became smaller, more private and meditative, coinciding with his increasing interest in poetry, philosophy, metaphysics and music. From 1971 he adopted a basic format for acrylic paintings such as Dark Blue with Black Border (c. 1979; Southampton, C.A.G.), consisting of a central rectangle of one colour surrounded by a border of a darker hue, with the proportions and colour relationships precisely gauged to convey emotional states and different qualities of light. His work is distinguished from other Minimal art by its fusion of a Romantic sensibility, as represented by the late work of Mark Rothko, and a classical sense of form attested to by his allegiance to the landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Richard Wilson.BibliographyPeter Joseph: Paintings, 1973\u20131983 (exh. cat. by J.

{"info": "\n \n Technique and condition\n \n \n \n \nThe painting was executed on a single piece of medium-weight cotton duck canvas, which is stretched over a 23-membered softwood expandable stretcher and attached with wire staples at the rear. The artist carried out preliminary drawing in charcoal and the stretched canvas was then prepared with an unpigmented acrylic emulsion size, which was sprayed on both front and back faces and has resulted in a very stiff fabric. However, the canvas was then taken off the stretcher for the painting stage and only re-stretched after the painting had been completed. The paint layers extend right to the top and bottom edges, whereas the left and right edges have been slightly lengthened by the addition of thin strips of black 'strip lining' cloth. The end of the original canvas and the start of this black cloth are visible on the painting's left edge. The original dimensions of the work would therefore have been slightly higher and slightly narrower.\n\n\n\nThe paint was mixed up by the artist using dry pigment powders, which were added to the same acrylic emulsion medium that had been used to prepare the canvas and applied to the (unpigmented) primed canvas laying horizontal on floor. A variety of brushes were used, although sometimes the artist's hand was used to push the paint around. The purple background colour does not extend beneath the head and is the thinnest area of paint used, the canvas being visible through it in many places. The head appears to have a black paint under much of it, possibly used over the charcoal drawing to reinforce the composition. The paint was applied in a very bold and vigorous manner, with each brushstroke still clearly visible. Although the paint was layered over dried existing layers in many areas, much use was also made of wet-in-wet technique, which would have had to occur very rapidly due to the relatively fast drying time of the acrylic medium. The paint used for the head is very varied in terms of its texture and gloss. There are very large clumps of pigment still apparent in many areas, often over 5mm in diameter. Where pigment has collected the surface tends to be more matt, typically at the edge of each brushstroke. According to the artist, the head took 2-3 months to complete.\n\n\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition. Although the canvas is fairly floppy, the fabric is very stiff due to the acrylic sizing layers, and subsequently far less likely to cause problems to the paint layers from banging against the rear stretcher bars. This slackness is also a feature that the artist wants and so no attempts have been made to tighten it up. However, with the artist's consent, it has been agreed to frame the painting in a simple 'L-section' frame. This will provide a far greater level of rigidity and protection to the painting and is currently being constructed at Tate.\n\n\n\nTom Learner\nAugust 2000\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1995", "dimensions": "Support: 2586 x 3610 x 42 mm", "reference": "T07002", "title": "Head", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bevan-head-t07002", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07002_8.jpg", "artist": "Tony Bevan", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1951", "artistbio": "\n English painter. He studied at the Bradford School of Art (1968\u201371) and then in London at Goldsmiths College (1971\u20134) and the Slade School of Fine Art (1974\u20136). In his early work he painted single figures in a manner that suggested extreme psychological states. His use of charcoal and intensely chromatic acrylic paint, which he makes himself, give his painting a distinctively rich, scorched appearance. Bevan developed his psychological portraiture throughout the 1980s and 90s, often working in series on individual subjects. The social psychology of his work became more explicit in The Meeting (2.94\u00d72.85 m, 1992; see 1993 exh. cat.), a painting of nine male figures (distributed over six canvases) singing in a mechanical, disconnected fashion. The underlying existentialism of this work recalls the paintings of Francis Bacon, Bevan's obsession with open mouths providing another point of comparison. The tense frontal aspects also bring to mind the Expressionistic portraiture of Edvard Munch. Toward the end of the 1990s Bevan stripped his images to a bare minimum, producing a disturbing series of paintings in which disembodied heads float like scarred, trussed balloons. The rawness and directness of these works reveals the influence of Philip Guston, who evoked a similar sense of alienation and embittered survival. From the mid 1990s Bevan also worked on architectural themes, expressing similar states of desolation. Rafters (2000; see 2000 exh. cat.), taken from an unidentified location in south-east London, again uses thick charcoal and heavily pigmented paint to capture extreme psychological states.\nBibliographyTony Bevan: Paintings 1980\u201387 (exh. cat., essay M.

He worked at first in a fairly conventional realist style.\nIn the late 1950s he began to produce reliefs in wood, making use of his carpentry skills and achieving by 1961 a highly formalised abstract language. He responded quickly to the emergence of Pop art, adapting his language of forms to the creation of objects reminiscent of children's toys in their construction, bold colours and schematised imagery. Tilson continued throughout the 1960s to explore the potential both of grids as a structural device and of emblematic imagery linking, sometimes tautologically, the written word with the object quality of the constructed motif. \nAlthough much of Tilson's work in the 1960s retained a handmade look, by the mid 1960s he was making creative use of technology, notably in his editioned screenprints and multiples. \nIn 1972 Tilson began deliberately to project his adoption of a simpler rural existence. He again favoured traditional craftsmanship in wood. He became interested in the symbolism of the four elements and in natural cycles. In his paintings and prints of the 1980s he often used inscriptions and motifs drawn from pre-Classical mythology. His preference was later for a variety of more traditional techniques, including etching, aquatint, woodcut and carborundum, sometimes combined in displays of impressive virtuosity.\nBibliographyJoe Tilson: Pages (exh. cat., London, Marlborough F.A., 1970)Joe Tilson (exh. cat., Rotterdam, Mus.

He studied painting and lithography at Yeovil School of Art in Somerset (1953\u20137), Guildford College of Art (1957\u20139) and the Royal College of Art, London (1959\u201362), where he was one of the students associated with Pop art. Boshier juxtaposed contrasting styles within his paintings, but he favoured topical subject-matter such as the space race, political events and the Americanisation of Europe. In the autumn of 1962 Boshier went to India on a one-year scholarship, producing paintings based on Indian symbolism (accidentally destr.). Returning to England he adopted a hard-edged geometric style, often using shaped canvases, abandoning overt figuration but continuing to allude through form to architectural structures and to the grid plans of cities.\nIn 1966 Boshier turned briefly to sculpture, producing elemental shapes made of perspex and neon, in effect a jazzy version of nascent Minimalism. During the 1970s he experimented with different media, producing photographs, films, collages, constructions, books, posters and record covers. The diversity of this output was unified by his response to contemporary events, his insistence on the social context, his unmasking of the sinister aspects of advertising and his promotion of radical politics.Boshier returned to painting in 1979, and in 1980 he took up a teaching post in Houston, Texas, where he began introducing poignant, sometimes comical, figures into his canvases. Often garishly coloured and rough in execution, these painted observations of human behaviour earned him a new and devoted following.BibliographyDerek Boshier: Work 1971\u20134 (exh. cat. by D.

As the title of one of them, 'Paolo', implies, this shape was chosen partly because of its resemblance to the perspective studies of mazzocchi made by Renaissance artists such as Paolo Uccello and Piero della Francesca. The titles 'Radial', 'Ring', 'Inside Light', 'Blue Float' and so on, draw attention to the particular character of the individual works. Thus the Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives one of the definitions of 'Vector' as 'An imaginary straight line joining a planet moving round a centre, of the focus of an ellipse, to that centre or focus', which relates to the line that cuts across the centre of this work. Nevertheless the spatial structure remains extremely complex and resists any definitive reading. For example, the yellow plane on the right appears in relation to the green and orange 'vertical' planes in the right foreground as part of the 'roof' of the form, while in relation to the coloured planes at the top it seems to be the 'floor'. (Annette Michelson has published an analysis of the spatial ambiguities of this and another work of the series in Artforum, loc. cit.). All these paintings were produced by brushing gel-coat resins containing pigment onto a flat formica mould, reinforcing the hardened plastic from the back, then lifting the paint surface and fibreglass backing away from the mould.\n\nThe artist has summarised the stages leading up to these works as follows (letter of 21 April 1976):\n\n'I started painting in 1959 and soon after enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute. While at the SFAI I painted with oil on canvas - organic, painterly abstractions strongly influenced by the work of Clyfford Still.\n\n'In 1962 I studied at the Yale-Norfolk School of Art and visited New York galleries. I was particularly impressed by the pop artists (they broke the ice for me) and Frank Stella.\n\n'Late in 1963 I began to:\n\n(1) Use acrylic paint\n(2) Use masking tape\n(3) Shape the stretcher bars\n(4) Use optical colour\n(5) Use isometric perspective\n\n'These paintings employed various optical illusions, garnered from such diverse sources as Persian miniatures, early Christian mosaics, Paul Klee, late Kandinsky, illustrations from \"Scientific American\", or even advertising billboards.\n\n'In 1965 for my first one-man show (at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles) I painted a group of monochromatic paintings, acrylic on canvas, shaped on 4in deep stretcher bars. The perimeter of these one-colour panels defined an isometric or one point perspective plane. The concept of \"painting as an object\" was extended to \"painting as the illusion of a plane in space\" - literally, on the wall.\n\n'The year 1966 was pivotal in the development of my painting. Two point perspective was incorporated in a series of eleven paintings. The illusion of a slab divided into a nine square grid defined the irregular shape of these plastic paintings. Polyester resin plus pigments and dyes were substituted for traditional painting mediums. Liquid resin does not dry - it cures in about thirty minutes by means of a chemical heat reaction. Fiberglas cloth and mat replaced canvas as reinforcement and support for the coloured resin (paint). They were painted with a brush face down on a waxed Formica table mold. The illusionary plane nearest the viewer was masked out with tape and painted first, the furthest away was painted last. Layers of fiberglas impregnated with resin were laminated to the back of the painting. A wood stretcher bar the shape of the image was attached to the resin painting reinforced with fiberglas. (On later plastic paintings the wood was eliminated - the sides were molded as one piece onto the painting). The completed painting was peeled from the waxed mold and polished. I viewed the painting for the first time only after it was completed ....\n\n'I made small preliminary drawings for these paintings, then cartooned these classical three-point perspective drawings in scale on the formica mold.\n\n'In a given series of paintings one work led to another, although in such a series I tend to oscillate between a \"flat\" painting and a more painterly treatment'.\n\n'Vector' is No. 65 in the artist's catalogue.

It was the first time he had been back to Greece since 1940, and the beauty of the landscape seemed quite overwhelming. Though he had not come with any intention of painting, he decided to attempt a few watercolours of the landscape and bought himself a box of watercolours and some paper. Then, wishing later to try his hand at oil painting as well, he hired the local carpenter to make three stretchers and set to work: the oils included this picture and 'The Mountain Opposite I', another version of the same subject. He brought all these back with him on his return to Paris in November. The greater part of the Tate Gallery picture was done in 1955, but the finishing touches were added in Paris the following spring.\n\n'The Mountain Opposite II' shows a mountain in front of the artist's house in Lesbos and was painted in a friend's garden in front of the motif. It was therefore one of the very few oil paintings (only four or five altogether) which he had actually executed in Greece. His practice since then had been to spend the summer and autumn months in Lesbos making watercolour notations of the landscape from which he afterwards carried out oil paintings in his studio in Paris. He had painted this particular mountain many times, from a variety of positions: it is a hillside with olive trees and poplars. He likes this picture and regards it as very important in his development, but says that it is a little clumsy - for instance, he didn't know at this stage how to treat the poplars in the centre of the composition and ended by more or less leaving them out.\n\nThe companion picture 'The Mountain Opposite I' (coll. Sir John Sainsbury, London) is of the same dimensions and very similar in composition. It differs chiefly in being darker in tone, with a predominance of brownish ochres and blue-greys. It was reproduced in Cahiers d'Art, 1960, p.227 under the incorrect title 'The Mountain Opposite II'.\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.93-4, reproduced p.93\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Tempera and oil paint on canvas", "date": "1955\u20136", "dimensions": "Support: 597 x 806 mm", "reference": "T00089", "title": "The Mountain Opposite II", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/calliyannis-the-mountain-opposite-ii-t00089", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00089_8.jpg", "artist": "Manolis Calliyannis", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1923\u20132010", "artistbio": "\n Manolis Calliyannis born 1923Greek painter associated with the School of Paris.

{"info": "\n \n Display caption\n \n \n \n As 'Gloucester' demonstrates, Buckley frequently employs strongly defined abstract motifs combined with bold patterns. This tendency has an affinity with heraldry, and it derives in part from his longstanding interest in the English Renaissance, especially Tudor architecture. His use of repeated patterns relates to tapestry and also to linenfold carving. 'Gloucester' belongs to a series of his works whose titles derive from Shakespeare's history plays. In this case, Gloucester is one of the characters in 'Richard III'. This literary reference is underscored by connections with Italian Renaissance art. The linear elements and fragments of pattern allude to paintings by Uccello and Botticelli.\n \n \n \n September 2004\n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint, household paint, silver and gold metallic paints on 4 plywood doors", "date": "1986", "dimensions": "Displayed: 1982 x 3350 mm", "reference": "T07158", "title": "Gloucester", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/buckley-gloucester-t07158", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07158_8.jpg", "artist": "Stephen Buckley", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1944", "artistbio": "\n English painter and printmaker. From 1962 to 1967 he studied at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne under Richard Hamilton, also benefiting from contact with visiting tutors such as Pop artists Richard Smith (for whom he later worked as an assistant), Joe Tilson and Eduardo Paolozzi. As a student at the University of Reading from 1967 to 1969, Buckley began to present his paintings as substantial physical objects, constructed in frequently eccentric shapes and then decorated. The clues to subject-matter were often indicated in the titles, which could be allusions to places, for example Rannoch (1971; AC Eng); to the techniques used, as in Cut, Burnt and Tied (1971; London, Brit. Council); or to historic styles, such as Cubism, as in Head of a Young Girl No. 1 (1974; Liverpool, Walker A.G.). Often Buckley drew upon the everyday environment: in the early work by referring to crazy pavings, tartan patterns and prosaic interiors, and in the later work by alluding to more specific architectural details and by using cardboard tubing and plastic drainpipes as constructional elements. He not only painted with brushes on stretched canvas but also worked with improvised processes such as tearing, folding, stitching, stapling, patching, screwing together, nailing and weaving. Along with traditional artists' materials, he used house paint, shoe polish, liquid linoleum, perspex, carpeting and old clothes. Often admired for the breadth of his reference to other 20th-century art, Buckley used the abstraction of simple marks and bold design to convey specific moods and circumstances.\nBibliographyCambridge Works by Stephen Buckley (exh. cat. by R.

Largely self-taught, he helped his father, William Brangwyn, who was an ecclesiastical architect and textile designer in Bruges. After his family moved to England in 1875 Brangwyn entered the South Kensington Art Schools and from 1882 to 1884 worked for William Morris. \nBrangwyn's plein-air work in Cornwall from 1884 to 1888 resulted in a series of oils, exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists, London, in which the subdued tones indicate the influences of Whistler and the Newlyn school. \nThe earthquake of 1910 in Messina, Sicily, inspired a notable series of watercolours, while in etching, which he had begun in 1904, he evolved a monumental style using strong chiaroscuro. Industry, shipping and contemporary London and Venice were favourite theme, lithographs, war posters, and pageant, scenery and architectural designs.\nFrom 1924 Brangwyn was occupied with what he regarded as the culmination of his life's work, for panels for the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords. These were rejected by the Lords as being too flamboyant. On completion in 1933 they were purchased for the Guildhall, Swansea: they are still in situ.\nAfter his murals of 1930\u201334 for the Rockefeller Center, New York, he devoted himself to religious art. Brangwyn paid little regard to contemporary developments in art and in his later years lived virtually as a recluse at Ditchling, where he had settled in 1918.\nBibliographyDNB; Thieme\u2013BeckerW.

During this phase I painted several straight \"Sets\" without the \"Tyranny\" problem; such as \"Sitwell Set\", \"Uncas Set\" (Guggenheim Museum), \"Parkin Set\", etc.'\n\nAs Robert Fulford, loc. cit., explains: 'In his Tyranny of the Corner series, 1962-65, Town decided that painting had emphasized too much the central image, so he pushed his concerns out toward the corners of the picture plane; now attention, rather than being directed toward a single focal point, was spread out across the canvas and the corners were allowed to contend with the central image for dominance'.\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.728-9, reproduced p.728\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1962", "dimensions": "Support: 2038 x 1626 mm", "reference": "T00563", "title": "Tyranny of the Corner, Persian Set", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/town-tyranny-of-the-corner-persian-set-t00563", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00563_8.jpg", "artist": "Harold Town", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1924\u20131990", "artistbio": "\n Harold Town born 1924 [- 1990]Canadian abstract painter, printmaker, sculptor and writer.\nBorn in Toronto.

Le Brun's paintings look back both to the mythological dream-like imagery of painters such as Arnold B\u00f6cklin and Gustave Moreau, as well as to the more recent painterly abstraction of artists such as Philip Guston. His mythological subjects and expressive handling of paint were allied with a renewed interest in figuration in Europe, particularly in Germany. Le Brun became seriously involved with etching in 1990, making a number of suites that culminated in the 1994 series, Wagner, eight etchings made with gravure and aquatint, to complement a commission of four paintings based on Richard Wagner's Ring Cycle. In 1996 he began making small sculptures in bronze in which he continued to use his horse and disc motifs, for instance in The Motif is not the Subject (1997; see 1998 exh. cat., cat. no. 29), showing a horse standing alongside a large shield-like disc. In 1984 he made designs for a revival of Ballet Imperial (choreographed by George Balanchine) at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n James Hugonin's paintings consist of numerous, minute rectangles of colour located\nwithin a grid of ruled lines. This grid is central to all Hugonin's paintings and acts as a basic structure onto which the coloured marks are then intuitively placed. He has described this process: 'The grid I use is a forming principle, a structure\nto work with and to work against. It is a systematic structure imposed upon the surface, but if I use it inventively, it gives me tremendous freedom to create complexities of rhythm and pattern. I need something stable: the very regularity of the grid\nis needed to oppose the irregularities of the rhythms. All of these configurations that I put down are intuitively arrived at, they do not conform to any pre-planned system. I always want to make something that will defy the system I have initially\nimposed - the system of the grid itself' (quoted in James Hugonin, exhibition catalogue, Serpentine Gallery, London 1991, [p.3]). Untitled (VII) is characteristic of Hugonin's paintings in its scale and visual aspect. It is part\nof a series of paintings, all identical in size, begun in 1989 and exhibited at Kettle's Yard in 1996. When viewed from close up, as the artist would while applying the paint, the separate marks and their colours are clearly discernible, but when\nviewed from a distance they dissolve into a field of shimmering, indeterminate colour which the artist equates with the qualities of shifting light. It is Hugonin's desire to achieve in his paintings something of the experience of watching light, and\nshadow, moving across a wide expanse of landscape and to emphasise the dynamic and transient quality of nature: 'It is in the nature of my paintings that you can never look at them and see the same thing twice. They have no single focal point; there\nis no passage that is dominant. The eye may settle for a moment on a certain movement, but as it moves again across the painting that separated configuration will disappear and re-form: things do not stay the same. This is absolutely crucial to my work:\nwhat I am trying to do is to present the evanescence of things, to heighten the fact that everything is in essence transitory.

Initially he constructed site-specific installations by superimposing projected 35 mm slide images of figures and objects over their real-life counterparts. In the early 1980s he turned his attention in photographs to diverse imagery from the domestic interior and the world of commerce in order to speculate on the roles of technology and corporate power and on how their functions become accepted as an inevitable part of daily existence. In State of the Art (1984; AC Eng), for example, the assumptions of advertising, film and the mass media are questioned.

In these paintings, which were all considered as a unity, I painted them on separate panels with an astragal between, and I intended to do the same with my \u201cDuet\u201d, but decided after it was painted that the projection of the astragal did not suit the composition, so I butted them together, and I am convinced that was the best solution.\n\n'The theme of my \u201cDuet\u201d is one which has interested me very much recently. I like to relate close-up objects, such as fruit and flowers, to a landscape background, and to do this I generally use the view from my studio window as a starting point.

The triptych form was adopted to express (a) a law or principle, (b) its opposite, (c) its 'inversion' (cf. the term in music), i.e. differences in timing, etc. As he stated in a letter of 23 January 1962, this led to 'the Figure with the Three Entities. To me it is a Figure of great charm. It is endless in its variations and elasticity and it is firm in its mathematical ordering. I believe the Truth about it can neither be spoken or written. It is not three similar things added together: it is not one big thing divided into 3 ... My Triptych, I hope I modestly suggest shows many Things. How a Whole is greater or great because of its giving up its monster wholeness: the Parts have an enhanced life - by their going into whole. I painted the group of figures as enunciating the Whole: the rhythms of leaves, lights as defining the Parts ...\n\n'What I am feeling in creating Figure of Triptych is that though language can assist us, the Light real Truth can once come in the visual arts: where all is given at once. In fact we on this level should have no addition, no division. A Thing just exists alongside, as the panels in Triptych, its neighbours, movements etc.'\n\nIn a further letter of 6-9 February 1962 he added: 'I have left on my painting as a frame a narrow strip of wood into which and from which my mathematical points have gone and influences emerged, and which really should, if a Gallery refrained be included in the framing.'\n\nHe was unable to remember exactly when this work was painted except that it was done mainly in the 1940s and may have been completed about 1950; he thought that it probably took about four or five years in all. It is almost certainly the picture exhibited with the Sydney Group in 1954 as 'Triglyph with Figures', but this title was a mistake. The possibility that he did some further work on it after the exhibition cannot be ruled out.\n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.516-7, reproduced p.516\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1944\u201350", "dimensions": "Support: 654 x 1041 mm", "reference": "T00434", "title": "Triptych with Figures", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/miller-triptych-with-figures-t00434", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00434_8.jpg", "artist": "Godfrey Miller", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1893\u20131964", "artistbio": "\n Godfrey Miller 1893-1964A pioneer of abstract painting in Australia.

The Last Muster: Sunday at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea was phenomenally successful and assured the artist a lasting fame.\nHerkomer painted a number of pictures that revealed his sympathy for the poor and disadvantaged, a characteristic fostered in part by his own humble origins. A stylistically inconsistent painter, Herkomer oscillated between the delicate idealism of Frederick Walker (whom he greatly admired) and his own more vigorous and idiosyncratic style influenced by contemporary German realism.\nHerkomer also exhibited landscapes and Bavarian peasant scenes. He also painted two huge group portraits of town council members for the Landsberg Rathaus (1891, 1905). In 1899 William II awarded Herkomer the Order of Merit, which entitled him to add the prefix \u2018von' to his name.\nAlthough Herkomer continued to exhibit genre subjects throughout his career, the principal focus of his painting after 1880 was portraiture. The financial rewards of portrait painting enabled him to build a castle residence.\nA controversial figure because of his outspoken enthusiasm and no-nonsense personality, Herkomer was often in the public eye through his lecturing, writing and other interests. A pioneer of the British film industry, he made and appeared in several films from 1912 to 1914. His art school at Bushey, which flourished from 1883 to 1904, drew students from Sweden, South Africa, America and Australia, most notably William Nicholson.

The following notes are based on a fifty-page account of the origins and intentions of T01327 (including photographs and diagrams) prepared by the artist in 1971 in three copies, one of which is in the Tate Gallery.\nThe artist chose the images for the three panels from picture postcards which either he had purchased or had been sent to him. The images of the left and right canvases come from two postcards, taken on different occasions, of the same location in Battersea Park, London; the six images on the central panel are of six different British parks. The common feature of all the scenes is a park bench, and the general theme of the picture is mortality.\nPhillips was prompted to paint the picture after he bought in February 1970 the postcard of Battersca Park from which he derived the image for the first canvas, that on the left. In the foreground of the card was a park bench on which a group of seven people were seated. Phillips wrote that this card \u2018spoke to me directly of a subject I had long wanted to tackle, that of mortality. Stark light fused the group while better delineating its members in their isolation; and separateness. They were the assembled cast of a tragedy and/or its spectators: the ironic brightness of council flowers and the drab gaiety of the surrounding concrete parkland reinforced these impressions.\u2019\nHe thought, however, that although the image on the postcard was self-sufficient for a painting about mortality, yet it was not self-explanatory. He decided that he required further images to secure the theme: \u2018the supporting evidence should come from outside, from different people in different places who yet shared a phase of fate and were simultaneously condemned to act it forever and repeatedly on the surface of a postcard\u2019.\nIn March 1970 the artist purchased a postcard of Central Gardens, Bournemouth, and received one of Prospect Gardens, Harrogate. He bought another card of Central Gardens, Bournemouth in May 1970, a card of Old Steine Gardens, Brighton in June, and one of Pare Cefn On, Llanishen (Cardiff) in August. In September he found a postcard of the same bench in Battersea Park as appeared on the first card, photographed from the same angle and in the same season, but in a different year, the bench also being deserted. In November 1970, he acquired the final postcard for the central panel; it shows The Rest Gardens, Fisherman\u2019s Walk, Southbourne.\nThe six images from the postcards were arranged in the following order on the central panel:top left: The Terrace, Prospect Gardens, Harrogate.top right: Central Gardens, Bournemouth.centre left: The Rest Gardens, Southbourne.centre right: Central Gardens, Bournemouth (second purchase).bottom left: Old Steine Gardens, Brighton.bottom right: Parc Cefn On, Llanishen.\nPhillips wrote that the unifying motif of the work, benches (as the stationary vehicles of mortality), emerged very slowly. Certainly he had not selected the motif by July 1970: however by October, the picture was described as \u2018Benches\u2019. He believes that the acquisition of the cards of the Brighton and Cardiff parks must have determined the motif. In mid-August the picture was called \u2018Battersea Park; Bench Sadness\u2019.\nPhillips wrote of his search for the emblem of mortality: \u2018At this time I was also studying Emblem books of the 16th/17th centuries. (I had had a copy of Quarles since 1964 but had recently acquired Alciati and a facsimile of the Minerva Britannica of Peacham as well as borrowed copies of Whitney and Withers). Thus the search was now not so much for images of the topos \u201cmortality\u201d but rather for its emblem; where ever I found mortality I found benches.\n\u2018Admittedly other emblems suggested themselves: litter bins seemed also present on most such cards but were absent from the excerpt on canvas A (the Battersea Park bench with people) and absent from the Brighton card, which in another respect was such a potent icon.\u2019\n\u2018Much later in the painting of the picture it occurred to me why the association of benches with mortality was strong in my mind: my brother had told me (when I was about twelve) that the bench in front of Ashton\u2019s, the S.E. London undertakers, had been put there in order that old people might sit down to rest on it, and, dying there, provide trade. It was also on a park bench on Clapham Common that I spent much of the dismal day on which my father died.\u2019\nAt an early stage in the development of the painting the artist decided to postulate that the photographs of the various places had all been taken at the same moment in time, that moment being the instant represented in the postcard of Battersea Park used for the first canvas. He therefore decided to use the term \u2018Meanwhile\u2019 to link the Battersea Park image to the others. At this stage he was planning only a diptych. The discovery of the second postcard of Battersea Park prompted him to paint a triptych; the image on the third canvas represented \u2018The Same, a year later\u2019.\nBeneath the title on the left hand canvas is inscribed \u2018For all flesh is as grass, the grass withereth\u2019; this is a contracted version of I Peter i. 24,\u2019 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man is as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away.\u2019 Beneath the group of images on the central canvas, the postcard manufacturers\u2019 reference numbers as printed on the postcards are inscribed beside the postcards\u2019 identifying captions.\nWithin a few weeks of finding the initial image, Phillips was able to decide on a format. \u2018The format chosen resulted from a decision already made that the painting of Image 1 would conform to a system and that its procedures would be externalised in the form of a catalogue of the colours used in order of their use, as I had done in some previous works (\u2018Consider our Haven: Supplement\u2019, \u2018Thesis as Object with Scholarly Apparatus\u2019); the only difference here being that I wanted to make this abstract and procedural section significantly larger than the figurative image, in order to give sonic priority to the process. This priority is only one of area since the colours, although they are ingredient to the image, are antagonistic to it in their solidity, clarity and verticality; they serve to emphasise the atmospheric frieze they both support and bear down upon. The brashness and contrast of the stripes also makes the image seem more harmonious and unified than it would appear on its own and makes it have, despite its bright flowers, a more sombre and tragic mood.\n\u2018I decided to use separate canvases; partly because of confined studio space, partly because the picture was being already thought of as compartmentalised (a technique which also related to the postcard), and partly because of the flexibility of being able to add more units if necessary; in the background also was the fact that large canvases are particularly white and terrifying, and Adrian Berg\u2019s maxim that one should \u201cnever paint a picture that won\u2019t fit into a London taxi\u201d\u2019.\n\u2018The actual width of the canvas to be ordered was determined by deciding that the excerpt from the Battersea Park postcard would stand a magnification of times ten: allowing for some margin either side this gave a convenient width of 34 in. This magnification would make the image 8\u00be in. high. Thus the second canvas could contain six images of this same height surrounded by their individual colour charts and leaving a space for a text at the bottom which would also be 8\u00be in. high. The overall height of each of the sections of canvas B would then be 11\u00bd in. and this height was consequently introduced into canvas A as the distance between the bottom of the image and the bottom of the striped area: the top of the image to the top of the striped area would then be the same measurement as from the top of the image to the bottom of the space left for lettering. All the proportions within the picture arc inter-related in this way.\u2019\nThe artist was undecided for a while as to whether the stripes in the central canvas should run vertically or horizontally.\nThe widths of stripes in the picture was evolved as in other works, from a system of coin-tossing, whereby a flick of a coin would determine either one unit width, or part of a width: he chose a unit to be a \u00bc in., and thus, a width might be only a \u00bc in., if the particular face of a coin turned up singly: alternatively, if a coin turned the same face consecutively for a series of turns the width would comprise as many units as there were similar turns. In the first canvas, there were 67 intervals ranging from \u00bc to 2\u00bc in.\n\u2018I estimated that seven colour-mixes should suffice to paint image 1 together with an underpainting to give weight to the pigment. (The postcard after all only uses four, plus the white of the paper: I intended to apply the white rather than use the colour of the primed canvas).\u2019 A similar process was followed for painting the stripes of the central canvas.\nHe wrote of painting the third canvas, whose image, the second view of Battersea, was found after most of the others: \u2018I decided to imitate exactly the format of the first canvas, and divide this canvas (the third canvas) in the same sections and intervals so that it could be painted simultaneously with the first canvas. I determined also that no reference at all should be made to the image on the third canvas when choosing the colours to use in the first canvas, so that the image on the third canvas is painted entirely in terms of the colours needed for the image on the first canvas. This meant that the third canvas had to catch up with the first canvas: the first ten stripes were painted (and the image with them) in an imitation as close as I could get to the first ten colours of the first canvas. Thereafter the first canvas and the third canvas were painted in tandem, each mix being used for both panels: the more \u201capproximate\u201d look of the image on the third canvas arises from its being painted in colours impertinent to it. This is more noticeable in some sections than in others.\n\u2018A curious chicken/egg situation subsisted in this picture and others with regard to the relation of stripes to image. The image generates the colours to fill the stripes; the stripes condition the procedure of the painting of the image. The reason for the existence of more stripes than the number of colours necessary for the image is that a great number of stripes be generated for use in the studio, some to make pictures entirely composed of stripes and some to make other images. On balance the stripes have the upper hand and it is the painting of the image that is forced to he extended, artificialised, broken into sections and to be executed in inappropriate colours.\u2019\nPhillips began work on the canvases in April 1970; for the next five months his work was interrupted, but from the end of August he painted almost continuously until the work was completed on 16 April 1971.\nA major source of the painting\u2019s imagery was Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. \u2018The quotation that had been present from the early days of the planning of the picture . . . was Eliot\u2019s famous rendering (The Waste Land, 1.63) of Inferno 55\u201357 ... \u201cI had not thought death had undone so many.\u2019\u201d The main section of Phillips\u2019s notes ends: \u2018What I most wanted the picture to do is what art has always set out to do, to help people see the world; art continues as its main function (perhaps even more emphatically in the 20th century, or with justified urgency) to lead people to see more of the world, more in the world; the natural and the man-made, the spaces even that lie between things in the world, \u201cthe atomic facts\u201d (Wittgenstein) one by one.\n\u2018From this picture people may look at postcards (and back to things), may look at benches, may examine the actions they perform and the ritual places of these actions and come to view them as metaphors.\u2019\n\u2018From these notes it may seem that the painting has a pessimistic intention: the opposite is the case. It is a plea against dying, especially that premature death of the spirit that can afflict those who were never invited to have a life of the imagination. There is no cynicism present.\n\u2018It hopes to invoke a summoning of the will, in the spirit of Dylan Thomas\u2019s\nDo not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\u2019\nPublished in The Tate Gallery Report 1970\u20131972, London 1972.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1970\u20131", "dimensions": "Support: 1219 x 2762 mm", "reference": "T01327", "title": "Benches", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/phillips-benches-t01327", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01327_8.jpg", "artist": "Tom Phillips", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1937", "artistbio": "\n English painter, printmaker, illustrator and composer.

Final corrections were made in a letter of 9 February 1976.\n\nThe top stretcher bar is inscribed in ink: \u2018\u201cHampstead Heath\u201d by Sydney W. Carline/47 Downshire Hill/Hampstead NW3/April [? deleted] 191 [last digit illegible]\u2019. \u201833\u2019 is inscribed on the top canvas turnover. Both inscriptions were made by Richard Carline. The former probably in connection with the London Group exhibition and the latter following the artist's death when he listed and numbered the paintings remaining in his studio.\n\nRichard Carline recalls the artist working on T01997 at No. 4 Downshire Hill, where the two brothers and their sister Hilda occupied the upper part of the house. Based on a scene observed during either Whitsun or Summer bank holiday, it would have been painted while the artist was on vacation from or had finished teaching at Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire. It was his last important painting before seeking a suitable opening in the war services. (He acquired and practised riding a motorcycle with the intention of enrolling as a despatch rider in the army. In the event, he applied for and received a Commission as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, early in 1916). There is a gap of two or three years in his output of oil paintings until the Italian war paintings in 1918. In intervals of war service in 1916 and 1917 he worked on the production of his medal commemorating the Battle of Jutland and his design for the \u2018Next of Kin\u2019 medal, and meanwhile continued to make drawings and watercolours, some being imaginary scenes or fantasies and of war scenes in Italy, during intervals between flying duties, early in 1918.\n\nSydney Carline did not become a member of the London Group until 1922. T01997 was sent in for exhibition by Richard, who was then working or about to work at home for the R.A.F. section of the Imperial War Museum, hence the address given by his inscription, the Carline family, including their parents, having moved to No. 47 in 1917. Sydney was serving in the R.F.C. in Italy at the time, and the title as exhibited was given by Richard in lieu of instructions from the artist. In a letter from the artist to his brother of 5 March 1918 from 28th Squadron, R.F.C., Italian Expeditionary Force, Italy, he wrote: \u2018You are going to send the big one to the London Group, are you not?\u2019, which Richard Carline is certain refers to T01997. The present title was suggested by Richard Carline also, who feels that \u2018Hampstead Heath\u2019 is of lesser importance, except in so far as people sitting about on bank holiday is readily associated with the Heath and it was there that he got the idea.\n\nA drawing for T01997 (Tate Gallery Archive 7510.14; image size 9 1/4\u00d711 5/8 and two oil studies (private collection) preceded the finished painting. The simple pencil outline drawing shows what appears to be part of a circular flower bed in the top section of the composition, without the two tree trunks as in T01997. Highly stylized, the flower bed and flowers take the form of a repeated zig-zag pattern and regularly spaced circles. The earlier of the two oil studies shows an alternative colour scheme, in which the reclining woman is wearing a deep pink dress. Richard Carline wrote (letter to the compiler 19 January 1976). \u2018It was obviously a trial of the colour scheme which led to his doing a second one in a different colour arrangement\u2019 (slightly larger than the first). T01997 repeats the composition of this study for the most part except for changes in the rug and newspaper at the feet of the figures and the woman's posture and dress, which is blue with red speckles. She also has red hair in the study. In T01997 the rug at the man's feet appears to have been first conceived as checked but was later overpainted.\n\nCarline continues in his letter: \u2018I think he would have conceived the colour scheme in a musical sense and not in the least naturalistic. In fact, his work in general at that time, especially this one, reflected the analogy of colour and composition with music. This was stressed by Tudor-Hart in his teaching. Various friends were experimenting on these lines and behind it all lay the inspiration of Kandinsky\u2019. Sydney, Richard and Hilda Carline studied with Percival Tudor-Hart; Sydney after the Slade in autumn 1912 joined Tudor-Hart's Atelier in Paris and continued when Tudor-Hart moved his school to Hampstead in 1913\u201314. Richard and Hilda remained at the school until June 1915.\n\nAn aspect of Sydney's treatment of composition at this time, probably related to both the theories of Tudor-Hart and his significant work designing circular medals, is the square format of T01997. His drawings and studies and a variety of sketchbook drawings, both autonomous and related to etchings, show his constant use of this format, not apparent in his earlier work, which Richard Carline feels is an unusual choice. But it is repeated in many of his Italian and Eastern war subjects. Richard Carline has pointed out that in Tudor-Hart's teachings, it became important to decide on the precise shape of the canvas for the expression of the idea: a squarish shape was felt to convey recession or depth to a greater extent than a tall or long shape.\n\nT01997 is undoubtedly an experimental work, progress from which was curtailed by war service. Richard Carline suggests that the artist appeared to be moving in the direction of greater formalization and simplification of shape and colour, influenced in part by Mexican and Peruvian sculpture, seen at the British Museum, and in tune with the tendencies of friends Nevinson and William Roberts of the period just before the outbreak of war. Tudor-Hart's colour theories were a strong source of influence and also some degree of cross-fertilization between Sydney Carline's work and Hilda's, from which the rich colours might have evolved.\n\nIn 1926 Sydney Carline painted a landscape entitled \u2018Hampstead Heath\u2019, but this, like many of his post-war paintings, reverted to a much more naturalistic treatment.\n\nPublished in:\nThe Tate Gallery 1974-6: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, London 1978\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1915", "dimensions": "Support: 838 x 816 mm", "reference": "T01997", "title": "Bank Holiday on Hampstead Heath", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/carline-bank-holiday-on-hampstead-heath-t01997", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01997_8.jpg", "artist": "Sydney Carline", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1888\u20131929", "artistbio": "\n Sydney W.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n John Aldridge is now best remembered for his gentle pastoral landscapes of Great Bardfield, the Essex hamlet where he settled in 1933 and lived for the rest of his life. But in 1931 he was one of the small number of painters invited by Ben Nicholson (1894-1982) to join the avant-garde Seven and Five Society, an exhibiting group through which Nicholson sought to promote modernism in Britain. It was perhaps the spareness and formal rigour of Aldridge's early work that Nicholson admired.\n\nAldridge painted Head and Fruit in 1930 and sent it to the January 1931 Seven and Five exhibition held at the Leicester Galleries. He continued to exhibit with the group until 1934. The picture's tilted table-top, still life subject and its scrubbed-down paint surface have obvious affinities with Nicholson's own work. But the subject-matter also harked back to somewhat earlier Cubist pictures by Picasso (1881-1973) and Braque (1882-1963), and to still life paintings by C\u00e9zanne (1839-1906) and Matisse (1869-1954). These were all artists generally little known in Britain until Roger Fry's influential Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition held in 1912, which caused considerable critical furore in the press. In conservative circles they continued to be viewed with a mixture of derision and suspicion. Aldridge himself is likely to have encountered such works during his visits to France and widespread travels on the Continent in the late 1920s.\n\nAldridge takes a high viewpoint, looking down on the table as if it is artificially tilted. Behind is a curtain or wall-hanging with a bold, modernist-inspired diamond pattern, while on the far left is what appears to be tongue and groove wall panelling or else a narrow-striped wall paper. The group of fruit includes an aubergine, a moderately exotic presence in inter-war Britain. Most striking of all is the carved head. This is reminiscent of some of the work of the modernist sculptor Ossip Zadkine (1890-1967), who carved primitive-looking heads with similar angular planar surfaces. Aldridge may have seen his work at the 1928 exhibition at Arthur Tooth's in London, or during his Continental travels. But there are also similarities to Head (1930) by Barbara Hepworth (1903-75), who was one of the central figures of the Seven and Five Society. Whether seeing such works inspired Aldridge to carve a similar head for this picture or whether it is the work of somebody else altogether remains unexplained.\n\nRobert UpstoneJanuary 2002\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1930", "dimensions": "Unconfirmed: 660 x 813 mm", "reference": "T07626", "title": "Head and Fruit", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/aldridge-head-and-fruit-t07626", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07626_8.jpg", "artist": "John Aldridge", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1905\u20131983", "artistbio": "\n John ALDRIDGE b. 1905\n\nPainter, mainly of landscapes, occasional designer of textiles and wall-papers, and book-illustrator.

Ensor repeatedly introduced early paintings (with which the walls of his house were covered) in the background of his later compositions. However, no picture corresponding to this has yet been traced, and Marcel Mabille, who knew Ensor, has suggested that the figures may have been intended as 'spectators' looking at the still life.

Began by making paintings of middle-class interiors with one or two figures and with studies of effects of light, soon heightening the\ncolour. Developed by 1885-6 a highly personal fantastic style with grotesque mask-like figures, skeletons, etc., as a satire on the stupidities of human existence. His large picture 'The Entry of Christ into Brussels' was refused by Les XX in 1889 and\nhis work aroused violent opposition.

His father Zachary Kniller was a painter and the\nChief Surveyor of the city of L\u00fcbeck. In about 1662 he read mathematics at Leyden University before turning to painting, studying under Ferdinand Bol and probably Rembrandt. He was in Rome and Venice from 1672 to 1675, probably painting portraits of\nthe Venetian nobility, before settling in England in 1676. There he ran a successful studio producing replicas and copies. After being introduced to the Duke of Monmouth, he received sittings from the king and was launched as a court artist,\nestablishing a reputation as a portrait painter in the grand manner. In 1684-5 Kneller was in France, painting Louis XIV for Charles II. A court painter to James II and George I, he was appointed principal painter to William and Mary in 1688. He was\nknighted in 1692, and in 1695 received, in the presence of the king, an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Oxford. In 1700 he was created a Knight of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Leopold I. He married Susanna Grave, a widow, in\n1704; the couple were childless. In 1711 he became Governor of the first London Academy, and was re-elected annually until 1718. George I granted Kneller a baronetcy in 1715. At the time of his death in London, about five hundred works remained\nunfinished in his studio.Further reading:J.D.

Not deceived, Juno requested the heifer as a present and charged Argus, who had one hundred watchful eyes, to guard her. Unable to bear Io's suffering, Jupiter ordered his son, Mercury, to slay Argus, who did so after disguising himself as a herdsman and charming Argus to sleep with music from his pipe. Amiconi's fourth canvas completes the narrative, showing Juno receiving Argus's severed head, the eyes from which she took and placed in the tails of her peacocks. Mercury about to Slay Argus is the third canvas. The sketch is similar to the finished version in almost every respect, but omits its arched top as well as the figure of Jupiter, with his symbolic eagle, surveying the scene from a cloud.\n\nThe Venetian artist Amiconi (also known as Jacopo Amigoni) arrived in England from Munich in 1729 and remained there for ten years, establishing himself as a mythological decorative painter and also as a portraitist. In 1730-2 he was commissioned to redecorate Moor Park by Benjamin Styles, a wealthy city financier, who made a great fortune in the South Sea Company. Styles had purchased the house in 1720 and had commissioned the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni (1686-1746) and Sir James Thornhill (1675 or 6-1734) to remodel it architecturally. Thornhill was also responsible for the splendid interiors, in particular the Hall, but Styles disputed his \u00a31,300 bill which led to two lawsuits, in 1728 and 1730, which Styles lost. The almost immediate employment of Italian decorators to transform Thornhill's work presumably was a deliberate act of retaliation. \n\nAmiconi worked at Moor Park in collaboration with the Venetian artist, Francesco Sleter (1685-1775), and Gaetano Brunetti (d.1758), an Italian quadraturista, or painter of illusionist architecture. He had worked with Brunetti before in 1730-1, on the staircase at Tankerville House, St James's Square, London, his first project in England where Brunetti had taken the lead role. At Moor Park, Sleter is thought to have acted as master painter. He signed the painted staircase in 1732 and was responsible for the Saloon (although Amiconi probably contributed), where his Four Seasons are surrounded by Brunetti's elaborate, feigned ornament. Amiconi's fine Jupiter and Io series in the Hall is entirely his own work, the canvases replacing ones by Thornhill which had been of the same size and shape but which had treated a more ponderous, Augustan theme - scenes of Heroic Virtue 'taken from several stories of the Antients, Greeks &amp; Latins &amp; Britons' (Vertue Notebooks III, Walpole Society, vol.22, 1933-4, p.35). Amiconi's works are lighter, both in subject matter and manner as well as palette, and are characteristic of the work produced by the group of Venetian decorative artists currently fashionable in England. The rich relief ornament that still surrounds them survives from Thornhill's earlier scheme. \n\nA sketch for the second canvas of the series, Argus Lulled to Sleep, survives (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden) as does a small-scale mythological picture treating the same subject (Seattle Art Museum). The latter was probably not connected to Moor Park but was painted in England, for Amiconi's great friend, the celebrated castrato singer Carlo Broschi, called Farinelli (1705-82).\n\nFurther readingEdward Croft-Murray, Decorative Painting in England 1537-1837, II, 1970, pp.277-9.Elizabeth Einberg and Judy Egerton, The Age of Hogarth: British Painters born 1675-1709, Tate Gallery Catalogues of the Permanent Collections, II, 1988, pp.13-15.Annalisa Scarpa Sonino, Jacopo Amigoni, Soncino, 1994, pp.30-1 and no.13, p.86.\n\nTabitha BarberApril 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1730\u20132", "dimensions": "Support: 655 x 645 mm", "reference": "T01299", "title": "Mercury About to Slay Argus", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/amiconi-mercury-about-to-slay-argus-t01299", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01299_8.jpg", "artist": "Giacomo Amiconi", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1682\u20131752", "artistbio": "\n GIACOMO AMICONI 1682\u20131752\n\nAlso known, less correctly, as Jacopo Amigoni.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This portrait was probably painted in 1933 when Whistler was 28 years old. He stands confidently against a romantic landscape under dark, looming clouds, with one of the twin Boycott Pavilions of Stowe rising up behind him in the distance. Allusions to the eighteenth century gardens at Stowe in Buckinghamshire had also been made in the mural Whistler had been commissioned to paint onto the walls of the Tate Restaurant (1928). The subject depicted was 'The Pursuit of Rare Meats,' a story which he had devised in collaboration with Edith Olivier (1872-1948) whom he had met in 1925. A successful novelist, Olivier lived at Daye House in Wilton Park. Whistler painted a number of striking portraits of Olivier and the Cecil family, whom he had met through her. Olivier bought this painting at the private view of an exhibition at the French Gallery in 1933.\n\nWhistler painted a number of portraits and conversation pieces of his many patrons and friends, including Edith Olivier, Edith Sitwell and Cecil Beaton. He also painted a number of self portraits, the earliest dating from 1924. In this year he wrote to Ronald Fuller 'I am at present at work on a painting of myself; with a mirror beside my canvas. I find my sitter always most obliging, &amp;, unlike some others, always ready to pose for me when I wish' (Whistler and Fuller, p.24). One of the last self portraits Whistler was to complete shows him wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards on the day in 1940 that he received it. Four years later he was killed leading his tank into action on his first day of active service in World War II (1939-45). \n\nFurther reading:Laurence Whistler and Ronald Fuller, The Work of Rex Whistler, London 1960, p.25\n\nHeather BirchallNovember 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1933", "dimensions": "Support: 406 x 368 mm", "reference": "N05865", "title": "Self-Portrait", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/whistler-self-portrait-n05865", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N05/N05865_8.jpg", "artist": "Rex Whistler", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1905\u20131944", "artistbio": "\n English painter, illustrator and designer. Encouraged by his parents, he entered the Royal Academy of Arts Schools in London under Charles Sims. He did not, however, enjoy the atmosphere of the Academy and transferred to the Slade School of Fine Art, London, where he was considered to be one of the best young artists of his generation. Whistler embarked on an academic study of art history and architecture. He had no real relationship with avant-garde contemporaries, but an affinity with such classical and romantic painters as Poussin, Claude, Watteau, Boucher and Canaletto. He also showed a strong interest in Georgian architecture. After leaving the Slade, he was commissioned to paint a mural for the Tate Gallery restaurant in London: he depicted a pastoral scene that encircled the room, the Pursuit of Rare Meats (1926\u20137). Whistler was a prolific illustrator, creating hand-coloured pen drawings for Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (London, 1931); one of his best-known publications was OHO (London, 1946), a children's book with text by Laurence Whistler featuring reversible faces. He painted murals in private houses, for example at Plas Newydd, Gwynedd (see Capriccio, fig. 2), as well as a triptych at the Brompton Oratory, London (see Oratorians), and many portraits of members of London society, including Edith Sitwell and Cecil Beaton (both priv. cols).

He studied at the Pratt Institute, New York, where he was awarded his BFA in 1971. Often grouped with postmodern abstractionists, he retained a strong modernist sensibility. Although his first works were tonally restricted monochromes, Winters was always interested in the context surrounding the nature of painting: he conducted research into the origin of pigments and made botanical studies. His first mature works were those that addressed botanical subjects. An early example is Fungus (1982; London, Saatchi Gal.), in which the plants are painted as if they were elements of a loose chart or index. Rather than being a topographical study, the forms are rendered in a simple, almost crude manner, reminiscent of the late paintings of Philip Guston. Combining a hierarchy of forms with a concern for mark-making, Winters created a fusion of painterly tradition with a postmodern practice of repetition and figuration.\nIn later paintings Winters drew on a range of sources such as architectural renderings, medical photographs and computer graphics, and to fold and layer the subject-matter in such a complex manner that the picture conveyed an abstract imaginary space. In pictures such as Parallel Rendering 2 (1996; London, Tate), Winters developed a painterly language of dense webs and folds that use hidden systems to form a suggested core or interior space.BibliographyTerry Winters: Eight Paintings (exh. cat., essay J.

(but not exhibited); Teddy Brunius, B\u00e6rtling: Discoverer of Open Form\n(Stockholm-New York 1965), p.32 in colour \n\nBaertling has written as follows about this work and his procedure in general (letter of 21 December 1965): \n\n'I work at about 10 to 15 paintings and a sculpture simultaneously. Each day I work at one unfinished painting. I devote one day's work to each painting, continuing with the next painting at work the following day and so forth until the stage is reached when I am ready to hang up one of them on the wall in my studio for further control. There it will hang while I study it every day in order to perfect it further and further. Mostly when the painting has come as far as to hang on the wall the colour is perfect, but it happens that I find that the colour temperature is not exact and I have to give some of the field a new layer of colour. The lines I usually find need millimetres in several places to bring out the maximum of dynamics. You may understand that my art is that of immaterial spaces in strong dynamics. To achieve this phenomenon, that the surface stops being a surface but works with the effect of immaterial spaces with high velocities the composition must be distinct, the colour temperature exact and the lines must have these small oscillations at all the right places. So one day the painting begins to live, to become spaces and dynamics in high velocity.The function of the lines is that of dirigating the movement but they also have a value in themselves as a part of the expression. Josef Albers, for instance, uses an imaginary line permitting the colour to transcend the borders creating a new colour in the border areas that does not exist but in the viewer's eye. In my paintings the colour never transcends the black line but is thrown back and thus adds to the power potentiation in the field. The after-image effects at the border lines help to activate the surfaces - Teddy Brunius has written in detail about this phenomenon. \n\n'So, when the painting has been on the wall for a month or two - sometimes for a year - it is put in a special part of my studio where the paintings are being stored. \n\n'About 10 paintings at a time are constantly hanging in my studio for after control, removed one by one as I consider them perfect and replaced by new works that have reached the wanted stage of development. So my work goes on consistently. \n\n'The creation of every new work is born out of compelling inner necessity. When creating a new composition I have a clear conception of the composition in my mind before getting to work. I draw out the lines directly on the canvas and give the surfaces the first layer of colour. At this stage the lines are only marked with lead-pencil and are absolutely straight, which is not the case in the finished paintings. And so the picture takes its place in the row of paintings at work. The colours are applied layer by layer 2 to 7 and more layers on the different fields. Nowadays it takes about one year before I consider a painting to have attained the maximum expression. My friends like to say that I am possessed with a devilry of perfection but I have found that the spiritual content and message in my work is brought to a better expression when the materia is perfect. \n\n'As I am working at 10 to 15 paintings at the same time as well as controlling the works on the walls in my studio it is obvious that the paintings belonging to the same period are closely related. Mostly I am working upon 2 to 4 new different problems put forth in different sizes and in verticals and horizontals. The painting you have now in the Tate Gallery, ARDEK 1963, 195 x 97 centimetres, is related to ARDIK and ARDAK represented in the essay by Teddy Brunius, as well as to some other paintings. But I would not say that ARDEK can be regarded as part of a series. Every painting is to be regarded a fully independent poetic work and has been created by inner necessity. Obviously certain paintings represent certain similar contents. To accentuate the similarity in expression in the different researches I give the works with similar content similar names. These are pure constructions and have nothing to do with anything from the exterior. A painting with a certain name I can thus identify as belonging to such and such research work executed during a certain period. This system is applied for the last ten years, before that the systematizing was not fully carried out. As can be seen from the catalogue Konkret Realism there was a time when I used names of Egyptian and Indian gods, affluents to the Nile, etc. \n\n'The imagery language in ARDEK and thereto related paintings is vertical with dominance of violet, black - in one of them also green - and the so called Baertling-white that has a hard, cold blue-green tone. There are no diagonals in these paintings, only obliques. Mainly open angles with the apexes downward dominate the composition, the apexes beyond the edge of the canvas - works with a profound monumental rising, the dynamics is not openly exposed, the imagery magic emanating from besides the compositional construction mainly from the power of the violet colour. There is a parallel research to be found in some horizontal paintings of the same size - ARDALK ARDELK ARDILK - all from 1963, but the spiritual content is here quite otherwise.' \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.27-8, reproduced p.27 \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1963", "dimensions": "Support: 1949 x 968 mm", "reference": "T00747", "title": "Ardek", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/baertling-ardek-t00747", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00747_8.jpg", "artist": "Olle Baertling", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1911\u20131981", "artistbio": "\n Olle Baertling born 1911 [- 1981]Swedish abstract painter and sculptor, born in\nHalmstad.

Self-taught as an artist, he began to paint in 1969. Influenced by land art and especially by the writings of Robert Smithson, he first exhibited installations of large paintings that envelop the viewer, and that incorporate material taken from the wild. In the mid 1970s he also realised a number of projects in the countryside around London. In the late 1970s he changed direction when he began to make more gestural abstract paintings; these were still the result of research on site, in the form of drawings and photographs (which were often attached to canvas to form a ground for the paint), but they marked a decisive move towards more subjective and Romantic interests. Typically at this time he worked with diptych formats, pairing a large photographic image with a painted surface. Beside the Bramble Ditch (1983; Preston, Harris Mus. &amp; A.G.) is typical of his violent, choppy and gestural abstraction of the early 1980s, the strong contrast of white against darker colours suggesting a pattern which would continue over the next two decades. In the early 1990s he evolved a softer style of billowing veils and dramatic spatial effects. Hartgrove Painting No. 2 (1992\u20133; see 1994 exh. cat., p. 13), a large black and white canvas from a series made at his rural Dorset home, exemplifies McKeever's use of grid structures in this period, and further demonstrates his interest in colour contrasts.\nBibliographyIan McKeever: Paintings 1978\u20131990 (exh. cat., essays L.

Hitler always thought of himself as a German knight. The medieval houses at the bottom are of a type still quite common in Germany. One of them has a wall that is broken - it is a Jewish house. At the upper right is a uniform of the SS, with an iron cross. The strips of newspaper and the little flag have signs on them like swastikas, though he avoided putting actual swastikas. Months after the picture was finished he realised that the shape formed by the uniform, the two largest areas of newspaper and the zone below looked like a Nazi jackboot; this effect was produced quite unconsciously. Ringing bells at the top, to left and right, allude to the church bells which rang in the new Reich. \n\nCrystal Night\nCrystal Night was the night (9 November 1938) when about 150 synagogues were burned down, the Jewish newspapers closed, hundreds of Jews killed and thirty thousand more sent to concentration camps. It has become known as Crystal Night on account of the quantity of broken glass found in the streets the next morning. In the Bible, Jacob's ladder stretched from earth to heaven; in this picture one sees the topmost rung of Jacob's ladder, but here there is no heaven. In the upper part of the picture appear two hands of Adam and God (left and right) from Michaelangelo's 'Creation of Adam', but this time they are not free for both are tied. Strings lead from them to marionettes. On the left is a newspaper on which appears the face of Michaelangelo's Adam; but it is depicted as a double head like Janus's which also has its dark counterpart (suggestive of Adam's bad shadow or the evil side of mankind). The strings stretch further and are attached to shapes like cards. On three of these cards there is the mouth of Hitler shouting and ranting; on three others, Hitler's moustache. In addition there are three with hieroglyphs intended to suggest in an ambiguous manner the opening letters of Hitler's name and also the swastika emblem. Strings then lead to ninepins which are in the act of falling - these are the Jews. The ninepins are forever falling, without having committed any fault or any crime. They are situated above Jacob's ladder. All that is left for the Jews is Psalm LXIX written on the parchment. \n\nHouse No.5\nThis is a house in a concentration camp (though not a specific one). The two candles have lost their flames, which have become detached. Orthodox Jews, like members of various other religions, have the custom of lighting candles for the dead. To the right of the centre is a woman with a concentration camp number on her dress and a real medieval cabalistic sign symbolising the spheres of the soul. At the bottom right is a form like a stove which has six flames in it, one for each million of the 6,000,000 Jews who were burnt. At the top right further flames are drifting out into the surrounding air. Who then is still alive? Only the mouse in the extreme bottom corner.\nAs in the first picture, the church bells are ringing (at the top). The triptych begins and ends with the bells, like a nightmare. \n\nThe artist added that everything in the picture had a precise meaning for him, but he didn't want to be too obvious or literary. His aim was to give shape to a feeling, by means of hieroglyphs or signs. \n\nIn a letter to William Sandberg, the Director of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, written from Jerusalem on 15 August 1960, Ardon said that he had made a slight addition to the 'Black Sermon' (i.e. 'Missa Dura') and gave the following commentary (translated here from the German): \n\n'In the beginning were Knight, Newspaper and Decree.\nThen the jackboot sang:\n\"The crooked Jews run back and forth ...\" \n\nPsalm LXIX is rasped;\nWords choke in parchment\nWhile mouth cries and moustache shrills. \n\nMidnight, and the ninepins tumble into the grave\nthey themselves have dug. \n\nFlame left its wick,\nheart's ripped from yellow badge.\nAnd the mouse appeared,\nonly she knew her way about.\nHe blessed her and the spring of '33,saw it was good. Then there was night,\nthen morning ...' \n\nThe artist told the compiler that this was not really a poem but a note, and does not exist in any more complete form. After he finishes a picture - but only after it is finished - he sometimes feels the need to add some words. The lines 'He blessed her and the spring of '33 | saw it was good' are of course a biblical echo, but are used here not without a note of irony. \n\nHe said that the only study he made for this triptych was a very small oil and collage study for the left-hand panel, now in the collection of Prof. Leo Picard of Jerusalem. \n\n(These notes were based on information from the artist 4 April 1973, and were subsequently approved by him). \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.19-21, reproduced p.19\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1958\u201360", "dimensions": "Displayed: 195 x 520 mm", "reference": "T00608", "title": "Missa Dura: The Knight, Crystal Night, House No. 5", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/ardon-missa-dura-the-knight-crystal-night-house-no-5-t00608", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00608_8.jpg", "artist": "Mordecai Ardon", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1896\u20131992", "artistbio": "\n Mordecai Ardon born 1896 [- 1992]Israeli painter and teacher, many of whose works are\ndeeply impregnated with Jewish mysticism and religion.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Viale Santa Panagia is a street which runs through the ancient Greek quarters of Tyche and Akradina in Siracusa, a Sicilian city that Guttuso was fond of and visited frequently in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1956, when he painted this work, Guttuso visited an exhibition in Aix-en-Provence, France, commemorating the fiftieth year of Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s death and reviewed it for the Italian art periodical Il Contemporaneo. Although it is unclear whether his visit to Aix predated this painting, it is evident that at the time Guttuso was thinking about C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work, particularly what he described as the French artist\u2019s formal search, \u2018which is not troubled by intellectualism, which is not an end in itself (formalism), rather it is always bound to its object.\u2019 (Quoted in Crispolti 1984, p.xxii.) Here Guttuso depicted a group of houses as simple blocks of geometrical shapes, often completely devoid of details such as door of windows. He used somber shades with occasional accents in vibrant red, his signature colour, and applied the paint with a combination of palette knife and paintbrush, handling it more loosely in the painting\u2019s foreground than in the areas of the houses themselves and the sky.\n\nA prominent artist whose work had been deemed controversial by the Italian fascist regime, in 1955 Guttuso was described by the British critic John Berger in 1955 as \u2018the most significant European painter of the post-war period\u2019 (quoted in Fabio Carapezza Guttuso et al, Guttuso, Milan 1999, p.29). By this time he had became one of the main protagonists in debates about figuration and abstraction in Italy and abroad. In March 1955 he took part in a high-profile debate over realism versus abstraction, with the British painter Patrick Heron putting the case forward for abstraction and the philosopher Ernst Gombrich as chair, at the Italian Institute in London. In 1956, the year he painted Santa Panagia, the artist wrote about creatively reconstructing \u2018the real\u2019 and \u2018the necessity to give shape to general situations of revolt, of horror, of joy, of eroticism, of destruction, in a panic order in which feelings are no longer tied to the man or the fact that generates them, but to a general human condition\u2019 (quoted in Crispolti 1984, p.xxvii).\n\nFurther reading:\nEnrico Crispolti, Catalogo ragionato generale dei dipinti di Renato Guttuso, vol.2, Milan 1984, pp.xxii-xxix\nJames Hyman, \u2018A \u201cPioneer Painter\u201d: Renato Guttuso and Realism in Britain\u2019, Guttuso, exhibition catalogue, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 1996, pp.39-53\nGiorgia Bottinelli, \u2018Renato Guttuso\u2019, in Jennifer Mundy (ed.), The Gift of Gustav and Elly Kahnweiler, exhibition catalogue, Tate, London 2004, pp.45-6, reproduced p.47 in colour\n\nGiorgia Bottinelli\nMarch 2004\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1956", "dimensions": "Support: 691 x 781 mm", "reference": "T06829", "title": "Santa Panagia (Sicily)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/guttuso-santa-panagia-sicily-t06829", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06829_8.jpg", "artist": "Renato Guttuso", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1912\u20131987", "artistbio": "\n Renato Guttuso born 1912 [- 1987]Italian painter and polemicist, the leader of the\nsocial realist group in Italy.

Even in his early work of the late 1950s and early 1960s Baselitz rebelled against the dominance of abstract painting.. The imagery in these early works, symbolic of the body and its organs and of sexual obsessions, borders on the traumatic. \nFrom the mid 1960s he concentrated on several figure types, sometimes portrayed as scarred or wounded but presented in a stylised form as modern heroes, as people from a mythical land beyond our questionable civilisation. \nFrom 1969 Baselitz painted his subjects upside down, seeing in this method the possibility of stressing the realisation of the motif as a painted surface and the form as his primary concern. \nAfter moving in 1975 to Derneburg, near Hildesheim, Baselitz served as professor of painting at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste in Karlsruhe (1977\u201382) and at the Hochschule der Bildenden K\u00fcnste in West Berlin (1983\u20138). Although he continued to present the medium itself as his primary vehicle of expression, in the 1980s he again gave greater weight to subject-matter.\nIn 1979 Baselitz began work on his first monumental sculptures in wood, for which he employed an elemental and deliberately unpolished technique that gave his figures and heads an archetypal forcefulness. Having worked for many years against the mainstream of contemporary art, by the 1980s he had established an international reputation through his influence on the young German Neo-Expressionist painters referred to in Germany as the \u2018Neue Wilden'.\nBibliographyGeorg Baselitz (exh. cat., Munich, Staatsgal.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is the only known oil painting by Beardsley and, unusually, it comprises two pictures on the one canvas. The first painting to be completed appears to have been A Caprice, a fanciful yet sinister work, depicting a woman in a black dress with green trimmings and a black dwarf in a red costume. On the other side, painted between the stretchers, is an almost surreal image of a masked woman with a white mouse. Both works are unfinished, and should be regarded as experimental\n\nA Caprice appears to derive from the drawing Comedy Ballet of Marionettes I, one of a series of three which appeared in the avant-garde journal, The Yellow Book, in July 1894. In both drawing and painting the woman is being invited by the sinister dwarf to pass through a doorway. The sexual connotations of this gesture are made more overt in the drawing, where the phallic form of the door is emphasised. Beardsley was constantly challenging the conventional view of male-female relations and in the second drawing in the series the woman approaches a door symbolising the female sexual organs.\n\nThe symbolism of Woman with a White Mouse also appears to be sexual, and Wilson refers to Freud's theory that in dreams such things as mice become a substitute for the penis. Nevertheless, although Reade, too, describes the symbolism in this picture as 'Freudian', he also points out that Freud's work was unknown in England in 1894.\n\nAware of the dramatic potential of black and shadowed areas, Beardsley contrasts areas of dark and light to great effect in both works. He also employs his favourite complementaries, red and green, to provide a stronger colour note in A Caprice. Stylistically he may have been influenced in these paintings by the early work of William Rothenstein (1872-1945), with whom he shared a studio, and whose pictures are inhabited by similarly bold and gloomy saturated forms. He may also have had in mind the work of the Venetian artist Pietro Longhi (1702-1783).\n\nThe title A Caprice was invented by the Beardsley scholar R.A. Walker who was the picture's first owner. The name invites associations with the work of the fin-de-si\u00e8cle poet Th\u00e9odore Wratislaw (1871-1933), who published a selection of poems entitled Caprices in 1893.\n\nFurther reading:Brian Reade, Aubrey Beardsley, London 1967, revised edition 1987, pp.341-2, nos.323 and 324, reproduced pls.329 and 330, in colour.Catherine Slessor, The Art of Aubrey Beardsley, London 1989, p.78, A Caprice reproduced p.78, in colour.Simon Wilson, Aubrey Beardsley: A Centenary Tribute, exhibition catalogue, Kawasaki City Museum, Kanagawa 1998, p.239, nos.114-5, reproduced pp.144-5, in colour.\n\nFrances FowleDecember 2000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1894", "dimensions": "Support: 762 x 635 mm", "reference": "N03815", "title": "Caprice.

He was brought up in Brighton, in genteel poverty, by his mother. She gave her children an intensive education in music and books, and by the time he was sent to boarding-school at the age of seven Beardsley was exceptionally literate and something of a musical prodigy. He was also already infected with the tuberculosis that eventually killed him. \nEarly in 1894 Beardsley was appointed art editor of the Yellow Book. When Wilde was arrested on a criminal charge of committing indecent acts, the subsequent scandal also brought down Beardsley. He was sacked from the Yellow Book on 19 April 1895 by its publisher John Lane, who had also published Salome, and he temporarily fled to France. \nIt may be argued that Beardsley was the most significant figure to emerge in English art in the last decade of the 19th century. In his first maturity from 1892 to 1894 he created a modern style that was wholly personal and, as he himself put it, \u2018fresh and original'. The content of Beardsley's art was as startling as its style. His ostensible subjects were drawn from Classical literature and history, the Bible and the social world of his own time; but his pictures express eternal human truths, given a grotesque force by the power of Beardsley's own fevered psyche. In his lifetime and immediately after, his work became widely known and admired abroad, and formed an influential part of the current of Art Nouveau and international Symbolism.\nBibliographyJ.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This large and imposing group portrait, which celebrates the dynastic conjunction of the financially powerful Huguenot families of Du Cane and Boehm, is arguably Hamilton's finest. It was very likely commissioned by Richard Du Cane (1688-1641) as a visual demonstration of his family's success and future fortune, to which Hamilton has responded impressively. Born in Scotland but working in London by at least 1728, Hamilton was held in high regard by contemporaries. George Vertue (1683-1756), writing on Hamilton's death in 1737, praised his 'easy graceful likeness' and claimed that it was the opinion of several artists that in some instances he 'outdid Mr Hogarth'. Here, working at what must have been the peak of his artistic maturity, Hamilton comes very near to Hogarth (1697-1764), skillfully handling a composition of great complexity.\n\nThe Du Canes were a Huguenot family originally from the Spanish Netherlands, who in the late sixteenth century had fled to England to escape religious persecution. Likewise, the Boehms left Strasbourg and settled in London in the 1680s. Both families were powerful forces in the City, with extensive mercantile and financial interests (several members of both families were Directors of the Bank of England). In 1730 the families were united through the marriage of Jane Du Cane (b.1711) to Charles Boehm (1699-1769) and it is this dynastic alliance, and continuity, that the painting celebrates. Richard Du Cane stands in the centre of the picture, at the heart of what is a hierarchic composition. Above him, on the wall to either side, are ancestral portraits of his father Peter Du Cane and his mother Anne Booth (holding in her arms the infant Richard); slightly to his right is, most probably, his second son Richard; while below sit his daughter and son-in-law. At their feet is their heir, Clement, to whom his father points and to whom his mother is linked by a skein of thread. The distinguished figure, seated in black on the far right, is most likely a posthumous representation of Clement Boehm the Elder (1660-1734), the founder of the Boehm fortune in London. He holds a piece of paper dated 1734, probably his Will, which no doubt was to the positive benefit of the assembled crowd.\n\nDirectly above the group, surmounting the overmantel, are the married couple's armorial bearings (Boehm quartered with Dilke impaling Du Cane). They appear again on the very high quality carved and gilded frame, of contemporary 1730s English craftsmanship, possibly by a Huguenot craftsman. Richard Du Cane had taken great care to have the Du Cane arms anglicised and registered at the College of Arms in 1731, and the picture seems to stress his great pride in his family and its direct and demonstrable lineage. \n\nIt is unlikely that the space the sitters occupy is a real interior. The arms above the chimneypiece would indicate a Boehm property, either in London or Twickenham, although the portraits on the wall represent Du Canes. It is more likely an imagined space created by the artist, conjured to reflect the fashionable taste of his patron. Indeed, Hamilton has altered the d\u00e9cor, from an initial Palladian to a more up-to-date and dynamic Rococo (the straight edges of the frames of the ancestral portraits are still faintly visible below their new decoration). The extremely flamboyant overmantel is an elaborated version of the one Hamilton created for The Brothers Clarke of Swakeleys, circa 1730-5 (Yale Center for British Art). \n\nFurther reading:Elizabeth Einberg, Manners &amp; Morals: Hogarth and British Painting 1700-1760, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery 1987, nos. 62-5, pp.80-6.\n\nTabitha BarberMarch 2001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1734\u20135", "dimensions": "Support: 1016 x 1270 mm", "reference": "T07505", "title": "The Du Cane and Boehm Family Group", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hamilton-the-du-cane-and-boehm-family-group-t07505", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07505_8.jpg", "artist": "Gawen Hamilton", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " c.1698\u20131737", "artistbio": "\n GAWEN HAMILTON, attributed to 1698\u20131737\n\nOne of the first generation of native-born painters of conversation pieces, coming close to Hogarth in style and considered by the not altogether unprejudiced Vertue to be even his superior \u2018in Colouring and easy gracefull likeness\u2019.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n Purchased with assistance from the American Fund for the Tate Gallery, the Friends of the Tate Gallery and the Evelyn, Lady Devonshire Fund 2001T07746\n\nMalcolm Morley grew up in London during the Second World War. He attended Camberwell School of Art and then the Royal College of Art. In 1958, a year after graduating, he moved to New York where he has lived ever since. \n\nMorley's oeuvre is characterised by its great stylistic diversity. This ranges from the Photorealism of the 1960s and 1970s, to the Neo-Expressionism of the 1980s and the still life paintings based upon balsa wood models of the 1990s. Yet the motifs Morley employs show great consistency: images of cruise liners, tugs, aeroplanes and light houses continually appearing. With this recycled cast of motifs, Morley explores a range of themes to which he obsessively returns. Paintings evoking middle class aspirations and the American Dream, or paradise-like tropical islands contrast with others of the good life's dark underbelly in traumatic images of plane crashes, sinking ships and violent, mythic scenarios drawn from Greek tragedy. Morley's paintings reflect his interest in conflict and catastrophe, an experience he had grown up with: 'I was subject to bombing and brought up on war films.' (Quoted in Whitfield 2001, p.15.) \n\nSince the early 1990s memories of childhood events and activities have played an increasingly significant role for Morley. As a child he enjoyed making model ships and aeroplanes. However, during the Blitz he witnessed his favourite model boat, HMS Nelson, being blown apart by a bomb which fell near his home. During psychoanalysis he recovered the memory of this 'loss of the beloved object,' (quoted in Adams, p.6) and, as a result, he started making colourful balsa wood models. He then assembled the model ships and aeroplanes into still life scenes from which to paint. Morley's works of the 1990s are painted in a trompe l'oeil style with heraldic clarity and obsessive craft. The paintings depict imaginary adventure scenes or sensational maritime disasters in which boats and planes from different epochs are juxtaposed, thus ignoring all historical specificity. \n\nMariner represents the summation of Morley's experiments of the '90s. It consists of brightly coloured reworkings of four earlier, model based, maritime disaster paintings. Man Overboard 1994 (Baumgartner Gallery, New York) is on the top left and Racing the New World 1995 (Emilio Mazzoli Galleria d'Arte, Modena) is on the top right. Slavonia 1994 (Mr and Mrs Donald M. Cox Collection) is on the bottom right and Keepers of the Lighthouse 1994 (Ninah and Michael Lynne Collection, New York) is on the bottom left. To create Mariner Morley scanned slides of the earlier paintings into a computer. An assistant then used the computer program PhotoShop to cut-and-paste a rough compositional draft. Morley then squared up the canvas with a grid, carefully painting in one box at a time. He also flipped the canvas in order to work upside down and attached transparencies of the earlier paintings to a light box next to the canvas to work from them more easily. \n\nThe finished painting appears as a chaotic amalgam of separate, discontinuous scenes. One brightly coloured trompe l'oeil image collides with another so that all perspectival logic is undermined. Toy galleons, tugs and yachts toss on the high seas. First World War model planes and hot air balloons soar in the sky. Planes and boats sink beneath the waves and a toppled lighthouse evokes Morley's childhood holidays in Morecombe Bay. However, despite the traumatic subject matter, Morley's painting suggests the games of a child in the security of the home, rather than the reality of disaster at sea. \n\nMariner combines Cubism's distortion of object and space with Morley's super-realistic, heraldic style. Morley juxtaposes disparate images to create a visionary painting inspired by childhood memories. Discussing the desired effect of his collage-like paintings, he relates his work to de Chirico: 'I am after making pictures that contain a combination of images that have the power to brand, in the way de Chirico hits. The images just get lodged in your brain - there is no way of dislodging them once they're there.'

Replicating the original in an almost mechanical way and conceiving of the painting simply as a coloured surface, Morley undermined the distinction between the abstract and the figurative.\nAlthough he abandoned Photorealism as a style in the early 1970s, Morley continued to examine the relationship between images and the objective reality they purported to portray. Even after adopting looser, more expressionist brushwork in the early 1970s, Morley remained committed to the conceptual approach to painting that had characterized his Photorealist works, with their focus on the process of painting.\nFrom 1975 to 1976 he produced a number of pictures depicting scenes of disaster. A series of watercolours and drawings of the archaeology and landscape of Crete and Greece, which he visited in 1982, formed the basis of some of his later paintings. In 1984 Morley was the first recipient of the Turner Prize administered through the Tate Gallery in London.\nBibliographyK. Levin: \u2018Malcolm Morley: Post-style Illusionism', A.

Her father, Benjamin Guinness, belonged to the wealthy Anglo-Irish family, and her mother, Bridget Bulkeley, was an artist. Guevara studied at the Slade School of Art in London (1923-4), in New York under Alexander Archipenko (1926), and at the\nAcad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris (1927). Her family wealth allowed her to enjoy a fashionably bohemian life in the course of which she met Christopher Wood, in whose paintings she featured. When her family thwarted their elopement, they installed her at\nMougins where she became attached to the household of Francis Picabia. In April 1928, she wrote the catalogue preface for his New York exhibition (Intimate Gallery) and, in December, Picabia did the same for her first exhibition, M\u00e9raud Michael\nGuinness, at the Galerie Van Leer, Paris. The influence of Picabia's contemporary 'Transparencies' series was evident in her paintings of overlapping linear figures.She married the London-based Chilean artist Alvaro Guevara in 1929. He\npainted the deceptively conventional portrait, Meraud Guinness Guevara, 1930 (Tate Gallery T01992) before they settled in Paris. Their daughter was born in 1931 but, although they remained close, their\nmarriage broke down in the following year. In the 1930s Guevara was friendly with Gertrude Stein and the Parisian Neo-Romantic painters. However, she turned to realism, reflecting her friendship and shared concerns with the sculptor Alberto Giacometti,\nthe Breton painter Pierre Tal-Coat and others. As a consequence, the work that Guevara exhibited at the Valentine Gallery in New York (April 1939) was introduced as 'a return to the sources of art' by the critic Waldemar George. Protected by her Irish\npassport, Guevara spent the war in the south of France, after which she divided her time between Paris and Aix-en-Provence. Alvaro Guevara lived nearby in Aix; with his death in 1951, Guevara became the main promoter of his work. In the 1950s, she\nexperimented with gestural abstraction on plaster panels, which she showed alongside her earlier realistic works at the Ohana Gallery, London (1959). Interest in her work was revived by an exhibition at the Salander Galleries in New York (1978). She\ncontinued to paint until prevented by ill-health; she died in Paris on 6 May 1993.Bibliography:Diana Holman-Hunt, Latin Among Lions: Alvaro Guevara, London 1974Alladine Guevara, 'Meraud Guiness Guevara, A Scrapbook of Memories or\nThe Book of Record Guinesses (From the Most Conventional to the Most Bohemian)', unpublished typescript, c.1993 Matthew GaleApril 1996\n ", "acquisition": "Presented by Salander Galleries, New York 1979"},

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \n\nBetween the Two My Heart is Balanced 1991 is a large painting depicting two women at sea in a small grey boat. Rendered in thick strokes of acrylic paint, the scene is painted from a vantage point inside the boat, facing the two women. The women, who are both black, are dressed in African-style clothing: the figure on the left wears a check-patterned dress and a tall black headdress, and her companion wears a bright red dress and headdress. At the back of the boat, visible between the bodies of the two women, is a pile of flat, coloured objects. The woman on the left is shown in profile, turning towards her companion while dropping some small blue objects over the edge of the boat into the sea with one hand. She holds a multicoloured item from the stacked pile with the other hand, which is raised to her eye-level. The woman on the right is shown frontally, but her eyes are turned to her left. Her face bears a pensive expression and she tosses small blue objects between her hands, while further pieces can be seen blowing from the boat into the sea to her left. In the background, the water is represented using turquoise, dark green and white paint. The horizon is very near to the top of the picture, so that the cream-coloured sky occupies a shallow band across the upper edge of the canvas. The scene is mostly made up from patches of colour and large, visible brushstrokes, and there is little detail shown. Although the women are depicted in a very flat, frontal style, the shape of the boat and the gradually diminishing size of the waves lend the scene an appearance of depth.\nHimid made this painting in her studio in Preston, UK, in 1991. The work shares its title with an etching and drypoint work by the French artist James Tissot (1836\u20131902) called in French Entre les deux mon coeur balance 1877 (Museum of New Zealand, Wellington), which translates as Between the Two My Heart is Balanced. In Tissot\u2019s etching, which is very similar to his painting Portsmouth Dockyard c.1877 (Tate N05302), a British soldier in a Highland uniform is shown sitting in a small boat between two white women, with a series of grander vessels on the water behind them. Whereas Tissot\u2019s work implies that the man is torn between two potential lovers, Himid\u2019s adoption of the title Between the Two My Heart is Balanced holds alternative implications, suggesting the struggles for identity and belonging faced by migrants travelling across oceans and seas.\nAccording to the artist, the pile of coloured objects that stands between the two women in this work, which occupies the position taken by the male figure in Tissot\u2019s etching, represent maps. That the women appear to be tearing these maps into pieces might be seen as a rejection of forms of knowledge and navigation traditionally controlled by white men. Himid has described the painting along these lines, stating in 2001 that it is \u2018a musing on what would happen if black women got together and started to try to destroy maps and charts \u2013 to undo what has been done\u2019 (quoted in Rice 2003, p.75).\nHimid was born in Zanzibar in Tanzania but moved to England shortly after her birth, and her paintings, woodcuts, installations, works on paper and curatorial projects have often emphasised the contribution of African migrants to the development of European culture. The African-style clothing worn by the women travelling in the boat in this painting suggests a connection with journeys from Africa and the complex cultural politics that are the result of such voyages. As the art historian Alan Rice has suggested, \u2018This utopic, calm scene depicts the survival of African culture despite the intervention of slavery and colonialism. The women take control mid-ocean consigning Western charts, which have been the bane of enslaved blacks \u2013 crucially allowing Europeans to steer more accurately between African and American slave ports \u2013 to the depths of the sea\u2019 (Rice 2003, p.75).\nThis painting is part of a series entitled Revenge: A Masque in Five Tableaux that the artist finished in 1992. Along with the rest of the Revenge series, this work was first exhibited at Rochdale Art Gallery in 1992. The series comprises twelve works (ten paintings, an installation and a drawing on paper) that includes figurative pieces depicting pairs of black women in a range of scenarios, as is seen in Between the Two My Heart is Balanced and Ankledeep 1991 (Tate T12885), as well as more abstract works suggestive of modernist abstraction and African fabric and textiles, such as Carpet 1992 (Tate T12886). Himid has described the intentions and interactions of the women in her \u2018tableaux\u2019 as follows:\n\nThe space they occupy is filled with them and expands with their ideas. They have several strategies, they expand to fill the situation. The women take revenge; their revenge is that they are still here they are still artists, that their creativity is still political and committed to change, to change for the good.(Quoted in Rochdale Art Gallery 1992, p.32.)\n\nThe series may therefore reflect Himid\u2019s reimagining of the role of black women in history, with the activities of her female protagonists forming alternatives to conventional historical narratives.\n\nFurther reading\n\nLubaina Himid: Revenge: A Masque in Five Tableaux, exhibition catalogue, Rochdale Art Gallery, Rochdale 1992, reproduced p.26.Griselda Pollock, Differencing the Canon: Feminist Desire and the Writing of Art\u2019s Histories, London 1999, pp.173\u20136, reproduced p.174.Alan Rice, Radical Narratives of the Black Atlantic, London 2003, pp.74\u20136, reproduced p.74.\nRichard MartinSeptember 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Acrylic paint on canvas", "date": "1991", "dimensions": "Support: 1218 x 1524 x 27 mm", "reference": "T06947", "title": "Between the Two my Heart is Balanced", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/himid-between-the-two-my-heart-is-balanced-t06947", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06947_8.jpg", "artist": "Lubaina Himid", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1954", "artistbio": "\n British painter. She studied theatre design at Wimbledon School of Art and cultural history at the Royal College of Art, London. She was particularly interested in discussing and tackling her position as a black woman through the practice of painting, and held the view that painting is the common form and tool for dialogue about art, illusion and prophecy. Conscious too that painting has a history of use in the adornment of architecture, homes, bodies and fabrics, and involves cultures and artists that are marginalised, she worked at a point of intersection between these two areas. She was best known for her sensuous, painterly rewritings of history: depictions of moments where women are within history and are active in determining and changing its course. In Five (acrylic on canvas, 1.5\u00d71.2 m, 1991; Griselda Pollock priv. col.), for example, two black women discard maps of a white, imperialist, patriarchal world. In other works Himid used patterns that allude to modernist abstraction as well as to the patterns in fabrics made by women in Africa and other parts of the world (e.g. Invasion, acrylic on canvas, 2.1\u00d71.5 m, 1991). All her work, however, addresses issues of painting and history, mourning such historical injustices as slavery while celebrating the pleasures of her own life and friendships and the sensuality of paint.\nBibliographyNew Robes for MaShulan: Lubaina Himid: Work Past and Present: A Room for MaShulan (exh. cat., Rochdale, A.G., 1987)Lubaina Himid: Revenge (exh. cat. by J.

Mario Merz Arbeiten auf Papier, exhibition catalogue, Kestner-Gesellschaft, Hannover, July\u2013September 1983, figs.18, 25\u201339, 45\u20136).\n\nThe painting combines three images or elements which have recurred in Merz's work since the late 1960s/early 1970s, neon, numbers and tables.\n\nFrom 1965 he has used neon tubing (first on three dimensional objects and later on paintings) to denote a state of flux or transformation and, after 1970, to record in numerals a process of proliferation of objects.\n\nSince 1970, Merz's work has been based on the number series known as the Fibonacci System (Fibonacci was the nickname of the medieval Italian mathematician, Leonardo da Pisa, who wrote the Liber Abaci in 1202). The number series (originally applied to the understanding of reproduction in rabbits) can extend infinitely and was seen by da Pisa to correspond to proliferation in nature. The numbers increase by the addition of each preceding pair, for example, 1+1=2+1=3+2=5; thus 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 etc.\n\nHere, as in many of Merz's works, images of tables are linked to the number system by neon numbers which spiral out from the centre in the following sequence. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. Glasses drawn on each table correspond to these numbers, suggesting an increasing number of diners, and the sizes of the tables increase as the spiral widens, implying an openended development.\n\nMerz has investigated different forms (all either linked closely to man's use or to nature, which illustrates the principle of dynamic growth (see also the entry for T03674). The image of a table, suggesting social grouping and interaction and the breakdown of hierarchies, is one which Merz has used from the early seventies. Germano Celant writes (Mario Merz, exhibition catalogue, Museum Folkwang, Essen, January 1979, pp.56\u20137, translated for the later Whitechapel showing):\n\nAs the igloo represents Merz's idea of territory and materials, the table comes to stand for the social interaction of the local community. Thus the table, through the rites of reunion and eating, transcends the boundaries between people and objects. Merz is no longer in the centre, but seated next to the others. Everyone in the ceremony has a sense of rapport with the others, a defined place in the entire space. A group or an individual can draw back into a private zone or can reunite with the others under the roof of branches or panes of broken glass. In this moment, the nomad, in the centre of a system of relations, becomes sedentary. He begins to occupy precise confines, placing himself near the other nomads and living with them, organising the space according to the presence of others. In this way tables are formed for one person, for two, for three, for five, for eight, for 13, for 21, for 34, for 55, for 89. As they proliferate they arrange themselves in spirals, in relation to the increase in people.\n\nThe artist discussed his table works, both paintings and drawings, with Caroline Tisdall in an interview in 1976 (cited above).\n\nIn 1973, Merz wrote:\n\n\nI reject linear, one by one, or assembly-line fabrication of spaces. I reject the idea that there can be a fixed number of people in a space.\n\n\n\nTables which belong to the reality of daily life have to be made either for a full space or for an empty space...\n\n\n\nFor one person.\nFor another person.\nFor two people then.\nFor three people.\nFor five people.\nFor eight people.\nFor thirteen people.\nFor twenty-one people.\nFor thirty-four people.\n\n\n[From exhibition catalogue, it is possible to have a space with tables for 88 people ..., John Weber Gallery, New York, November\u2013December 1973, n.p.].\n\nThis painting may have been one of those exhibited in Merz's one-man exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (September\u2013October 1975).

Much of his work was based around the Fibonacci sequence, a formula often used to express mathematical sequences in nature.\n\nMerz first studied medicine and as a young man living in Turin at the end of the Second World War he became strongly politically motivated, joining an anti-fascist organisation. After travelling to Rome and Paris he turned to art, making abstract paintings from 1960. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-1960s that he shifted his artistic interests to more complex objects, making works that involved neon lights and everyday objects. He was particularly attracted to exploring metaphors that reflected the relationship between nature and art, and his radical practice brought him into proximity with other artists working with in a similar manner. By the late 1960s Merz was one of the most important proponents of Arte Povera. During the course of his long career, Merz drew on a vocabulary of symbols to express his ideas, such as the igloo and spirals. \n\nThe two works in ARTIST ROOMS are rare early pieces and express Merz\u2019s experimental use of materials at the start of his career. Both Che Fare? and the large sculptural installation Lingotto have an important relationship to the practice of Joseph Beuys in their use of wax as a major component to the work, and reflect Merz\u2019s position in the wider European context during the 1960s. \n\n\n\n ", "acquisition": "Purchased 1983"},

His practice was to take the letters of a word such as 'mer', 'non' or 'midi' as his starting-point for a completely abstract composition. In the case of 'NUE' (which Denise Rene says should be translated 'nude' and not 'cloud'): \n\nN = white any kind of form = do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si\nU = blue = hemispherical forms = sol, la\nE = red = spherical forms = do \nThus the colours used are blue, red and white, with the addition of black, which according to his theory can accompany any kind of form. There are four semi-circular patches of blue and a circular disc of red (plus single triangles of blue and red). His last works of 1960 also included a picture entitled 'NU', executed in blue, white and black, without any red. \n\nThis gouache was one of a series made to be reproduced in an album of 12 screenprints, which was published posthumously under the title 'Herbin', and was also used as the design for a tapestry woven at Aubusson. There is a second, later gouache still in the artist's estate from which he executed an oil painting called 'NUE', which is dated 1960 and measures 92 x 73cm (coll. Mr and Mrs Paul M. Hirschland, New York). The oil includes a broader and longer white band across the centre, a much longer vertical white band on the left (stretching almost from top to bottom of the composition), and slightly smaller circles of colour. According to Denise Ren\u00e9, Herbin always painted one, two or three gouaches first and then the oils. However, they were never entirely similar works. He usually painted several variants of the same theme either in gouache or oils (letter of 18 July 1973). \n\nAlthough Herbin died on 31 January 1960, there are various other oil paintings and gouaches dated 1960. Mme Ren\u00e9 explained: 'At that time, he was working feverishly for the preparation of an exhibition in the United States and as he only signed his paintings once they were varnished, the number of paintings signed during that month is not at all surprising. Unfortunately, on January 31st, he was struck by a heart attack and met his untimely death. The United States exhibition was, as a consequence, cancelled. The only work unsigned is an unfinished painting in black and white whose theme was constructed on the word \"FIN\", incredible coincidence. Now, the gouache \"FIN\" on the same theme is signed and very colourful.' \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.362-3, reproduced p.362 \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Gouache on board", "date": "1960", "dimensions": "Support: 479 x 381 mm", "reference": "T00517", "title": "Nude", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/herbin-nude-t00517", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00517_8.jpg", "artist": "Auguste Herbin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1882\u20131960", "artistbio": "\n Auguste Herbin 1882-1960French Cubist and later abstract painter whose work forms a\nbridge between the Cubist movement and post-war geometrical abstract painting.

She produced a considerable number in which a frieze-like array of figures are represented by a matrix of intersecting straight lines punctuated by areas of strong colour. Two Figures (Heroes), 1954 is an example of this type, which was concentrated around 1952-4 but seems to have begun in 1947 with Drawing for Stone Sculpture, 1947 (Priscilla Beckett, repr. Alan Bowness, Barbara Hepworth: Drawings from a Sculptor's Landscape, 1966, pl.33) and continued until 1956 with Figures (Sunion), 1956 (Private collection, repr. photograph in the artist's estate). A comparison of the two examples owned by the Tate - one under a foot high and the other life size - serves to emphasise the wide range of scale covered by this body of work. \n\nThe painting was made, in large part, using a technique which Hepworth had developed in the 1940s for her nude studies (see Tate Gallery T00269) and hospital pictures (see T02098). A thick white oil ground - probably of household paint - was brushed on to the smooth face of the hardboard to give a hard, textured surface. A thin glaze of brown oil paint was applied and then scraped down, in areas to the white ground. The main design was drawn over the paint in black pencil, probably with the aid of a ruler; sections of the resulting grid were filled in with strong colours - red, black, blue, grey - and a pale grey was washed over some areas. The coincidence of scraped areas with the pencil design demonstrates that both were modified as the artist worked on the painting. That it was framed before it was executed is indicated by splashes on the frame and the absence of paint beneath it. \n\nThough in sound condition, Two Figures\nhas suffered from its past treatment. George Wilkinson, one of Hepworth's last assistants, recalled that after the artist's death the painting was found in the confined space behind the old stage of the former Palais de Dance that had served as her studio since 1961 (interviewed by the author, 14 Oct. 1996); her executors had the film of dirt which covered it removed. Since the establishment of the Barbara Hepworth Museum, it has been on display in her studio and has suffered from the humid conditions that result from the damp atmosphere. It was noted in 1991 that there was some local cleavage and flaking of paint, particularly in the black areas, of which some had been retouched - presumably by the artist - and some was more recent. Abrasion had caused the loss of a small area of paint on the lower right hand side and there were small splashes of white paint on both the frame and the picture surface as a result of decorators working in the studio at some time in the past. \n\nThe technique of intersecting lines relates to Cubism, in particular to the later Cubism of Georges Braque. The predominance of long verticals is especially reminiscent of his La Musicienne, 1918 (Kunstmuseum, Basle), which Hepworth could have seen reproduced in the special Cubism number of Art d'Aujourd'hui\nin May 1953. The suggestion of a continuous line also recalls Klee's conception of drawing as taking a line for a walk, which enjoyed significant popularity among the painters of St Ives in the early 1950s. In post-war Britain both Braque and Klee had come to stand for a more rooted modernism, and their influence on Hepworth may be related to her search for a form of expression that was both human and modern. Her use, in a figurative composition, of the primary colours and rectilinearity associated with Mondrian's abstraction may reflect such a humanising intention. The adaptation of Klee's line to a post-Cubist style, with the filling in of defined areas with strong colour and heavy pencil shading, was particularly characteristic of Ben Nicholson's painting after 1947, though his forms are less rectilinear than Hepworth's. The scraping down of oil glazes over a textured white ground was, similarly, a familiar technique of his. Her style may also relate to contemporary sculpture, in particular to the work of Robert Adams and Henry Moore, which themselves had their roots in Cubism. In Adams's Figure, 1949 (Tate Gallery T03866) the human body is defined by interlocking angular forms, though in three dimensions. Moore had used such forms in the 1930s, but they reached a very public peak in his Time-Life Screen\nin 1953-4 (Time-Life Building, Bond Street, London, repr. Alan Bowness, Henry Moore Sculpture and Drawings: vol.2, 1949-54, 2nd ed. 1965, pl.74, LH344). \n\nThe fusion of bodies in Two Figures\nhad been anticipated in such works as Bicentric Form, 1949 (Tate Gallery N05932) and may be seen to symbolise human relations, which were a dominant theme of her painting and sculpture. The artist related the idea of the group to her pre-war abstract work: 'It is an extension of the same idea which started in November 1934, but extended gradually from within outwards; through the family group and its close knit relationship out to larger group related architecture' (Herbert Read, Barbara Hepworth: Carvings and Drawings, 1952). Thus the classic Cubist interpenetration of forms becomes a symbol of the cohesion of people: of the family unit in Family Group\nand of the two 'heroes' of Two Figures. \n\nThe collapse of Hepworth's marriage to Ben Nicholson in December 1950 made the family an especially emotive theme and it is even more poignantly present in Two Figures\nwhich, as the inscription on the back makes clear, was dedicated to Paul Skeaping, the artist's son by her first husband, John Skeaping. Paul was an RAF pilot flying patrols over Malaya and died, along with his navigator, in an air crash in Thailand in February 1953. Though it is most likely that it was accidental, it has been suggested that they were the victims of a terrorist bomb (John Skeaping, Drawn from Life: An Autobiography, 1977, p.207). Since the age of nine, Paul had lived with his father, but he spent extended periods with Hepworth in Cornwall. Her close friend Margaret Gardiner recorded that his death was 'a lasting grief' to the artist (Barbara Hepworth: A Memoir, 1982, p.18), who, in addition to Two Figures, carved a Madonna and Child\nfor St Ives parish church in his memory (BH 193, repr. Barbara Hepworth: A Pictorial Autobiography, 1970, New ed. 1978, p.64). \n\nThe left hand person in Two Figures\nappears to hold a smaller picture, the forms of which echo the main image. The emphasis placed upon this detail by the thorough scraping away of the paint suggests that it is an important element of the work. The motif of a picture-within-a-picture has been used in the past as a means of including figures otherwise absent from the scene depicted; in particular portraits of the dead often appear in family groups. If Hepworth used this traditional device, the painting might serve, like Family Group\nand many of the other similar works, to reinforce the importance of family ties. \n\nChris Stephens\nMarch 1998\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint and graphite on hardboard", "date": "1954", "dimensions": "Support: 1850 x 1220 mm", "reference": "T03155", "title": "Two Figures (Heroes)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hepworth-two-figures-heroes-t03155", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03155_8.jpg", "artist": "Dame Barbara Hepworth", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1903\u20131975", "artistbio": "\n Barbara Hepworth 1903-75\n\nOf a middle-class family from the West Riding of Yorkshire, Barbara Hepworth was born in Wakefield on 10 January 1903; her father, Herbert Hepworth, would become County Surveyor and an Alderman. She trained in sculpture at Leeds School of Art (1920-1) and, on a county scholarship, at the Royal College of Art (1921-4), meeting the painters Raymond Coxon and Edna Ginesi and the sculptor Henry Moore. Hepworth was runner-up to John Skeaping for the 1924 Prix de Rome, but travelled to Florence on a West Riding Travel Scholarship. After visiting Rome and Siena with Skeaping, they were married in Florence on 13 May 1925 and moved to Rome, where both began carving stone. In November 1926, they returned to London. Links forged through the British School at Rome with the sculptor Richard Bedford (a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum), ensured that the collector George Eumorfopoulos visited their studio show in 1927 and bought two Hepworths. The couple moved to 7 The Mall Studios in Hampstead in 1928 (where Hepworth remained until 1939). With Bedford and Moore, they became leading figures in the 'new movement' associated with direct carving. Successful joint exhibitions in 1928 (Beaux Arts Gallery, London and Alex. Reid and Lefevre, Glasgow) and 1930 (Tooth's) consisted of animal and figure sculptures in stone and wood. They joined the London Group and the 7 &amp; 5 Society in 1930-1. A son, Paul, was born in August 1929, but the marriage was deteriorating and in 1931 Hepworth met Ben Nicholson (then married to Winifred Nicholson), who joined her on holiday at Happisburgh, Norfolk. She and Skeaping were amicably divorced in 1933. In 1934 Hepworth gave birth to triplets; she married Nicholson four years later.\nHepworth and Nicholson revealed their move towards abstraction in joint exhibitions in 1932 (Tooth's) and 1933 (Lefevre). This became the abiding direction of her work, epitomised by the pioneering piercing of the block, and coincided with experiments in collage, photograms and prints. Establishing links with the continental avant garde, the couple visited the Parisian studios of Arp, Brancusi, Mondrian, Braque and Picasso. They joined Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation, and were major figures in Paul Nash's Unit One grouping and the associated publication edited by Herbert Read (1934). In 1935 they were instrumental in restricting the 7&amp;5 to abstract work, thus paving the way for a fertile period of constructivism enhanced by artist refugees from totalitarian Europe (Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, Breuer, Gabo). This culminated in the publication of Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art (1937), edited by Nicholson, Gabo and the architect Leslie Martin, and designed by Hepworth and Sadie Martin. \n Such utopianism was curtailed by the war, and Hepworth and Nicholson evacuated to St Ives, Cornwall. They stayed with Margaret Mellis and Adrian Stokes at Little Park Owles, Carbis Bay. Domestic demands and lack of space restricted Hepworth to small sculpture and painting until, on moving to Chy-an-Kerris, Carbis Bay in 1942, she secured a studio. Her first major solo exhibition (Temple Newsam, Leeds 1943) was followed by a monograph by William Gibson (Barbara Hepworth: Sculptress, 1946). She was prominent amongst St Ives artists, forming a focus in 1949 for the establishment of the Penwith Society of Artists with Nicholson, Peter Lanyon and others, and helping to attract international attention to the group's exhibitions. Although Hepworth's contribution to the 1950 Venice Biennale was dogged by comparisons with Moore, two retrospectives - in Wakefield (1951) and London (Whitechapel 1954) - and Read's monograph (1952) confirmed her post-war reputation. She bought Trewyn Studio, St Ives in 1949, where she lived after her divorce from Nicholson two years later. She visited Greece in 1954 in an effort to recover from the sudden death of Paul Skeaping (1953).\n Hepworth was especially active within, and on behalf of, the modernist artistic community in St Ives during its period of post-war international prominence. Her experience of the Cornish landscape was acknowledged in her choice of titles. In a wider context, Hepworth also represented a link with pre-war ideals in a climate of social and physical reconstruction; this was exemplified by her two sculptures for the South Bank site of the Festival of Britain (1951). Public commissions and greater demand encouraged her to employ assistants for preliminary work - including Denis Mitchell and Dicon Nance - and to produce bronze editions.\n Hepworth's international standing was confirmed by the Grand Prix of the 1959 S\u00e3o Paolo Bienal, which came amid honorary degrees, the CBE (1958) and the DBE (1965), and a second Whitechapel exhibition (1962) and a European tour (1964). In 1964, Single Form was erected outside the United Nations building, New York as a memorial to the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. Hepworth served as a Tate trustee (1965-72), donating six works in 1964 and a further nine in 1967 prior to the 1968 retrospective at the Gallery. The catalogue raisonn\u00e9 by Alan Bowness (the sculptor's son-in-law) included in J.P. Hodin's 1961 monograph was extended in 1971. With her long-standing friend the potter Bernard Leach, she was awarded the Freedom of St Ives in 1968 as an acknowledgement of her importance to the town. After a long battle with cancer, she died there on 20 May 1975 in a horrific fire at her home. The studio was designated the Barbara Hepworth Museum in the following year and, on coming under the Tate's aegis in 1980, secured an unrivalled collection of her work for the Gallery. Since then, scholarly interest has focused on her status as one of the few women artists to achieve international prominence.\nMatthew Gale April 1997\n\nBibliography:\nHerbert Read, Barbara Hepworth: Carvings and Drawings, London 1952\nJ.P.

For some time this picture was thought to have been painted at Greenwich, but has recently been identified as the Pool of London below London Bridge, looking west towards the dome of St Paul's Cathedral in the distance. As Archibald has noted, 'The subject of this picture - tugs working barges - was something of an innovation, as painters had formerly concentrated on the more decorative types of vessels; however Wyllie's obsessive love for the sea and anything that floated on it, embraced every type and size of vessel. It moved him to cover every aspect of the working river and set a fashion that other artists followed.' (Archibald, p.204.)\n\nWyllie depicts in detail the huge variety of working boats on the river. The flat barges in the foreground, carrying their cargoes of coal and timber, were called lighters. They were towed by tugs and manoeuvred into position with large oars, which also served as rudders. On the far left of the picture the barge with a low mast was called a stumpie, the two-masted barge beside it is a ketch. Behind them are the tall masts of a brig, which has been brought into dry dock. On the far right of the picture, by way of contrast, Wyllie includes the two funnels of a passenger steamer, a symbol of leisure rather than work. The title of the picture is evoked by the contrast between the dirt and toil of the men working on the coal barge and the implied wealth that is generated when coal is converted into steam for industry. The dirt and grime produced by the tugs, belching their fumes into the sky, mingles with the splendour of two full-rigged ships behind them. \n\nWyllie was best known for his views of the Thames, and in 1884 held an exhibition entitled The Tidal Thames at the Fine Art Society in London. He also painted pictures of other important harbours and seaports in Britain and abroad, as well as ship portraits, sea battles and yachting scenes.\n\nFurther reading:E.H.H.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This provocative painting of a courtesan lying in bed is one of four known versions of a picture made by Matthew Peters for Richard Grosvenor, later 1st Earl Grosvenor (1731-1802). One of these pictures was almost certainly exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777 as 'A Woman in Bed', the first and last time Peters exhibited such a frankly sexual subject. Contemporary critics appreciated the work, although they were concerned that it was unsuitable for public display. The Morning Chronicle of 26 April 1777 noted:\n\nWe cannot \u2026 help thinking that the inviting leer of the lady, and her still more inviting bosom, ought to be consigned to the bedchamber of a bagnio, where each would doubtless provoke a proper effect; in the present situation they serve to prevent the pictures around them from being so much seen and admired as their merits demand, for every man who has either his wife or daughter with him, must, for decency sake, hurry them away from that corner of the room.\n\nBy this time the picture was already familiar to the public through a mezzotint engraving made in December 1776, entitled 'Lydia', and inscribed with lines from John Dryden's comic play Amphitryon: 'This is the Mould of which I made the Sex; / I gave them but one Tongue, to say as nay, / And two kind Eyes to grant'.\n\nMatthew Peters trained in London under the portraitist Thomas Hudson (1701-79), before making his first trip to the Continent in 1763. On his return he became a member of the Society of Artists, exhibiting portraits in oil and pastel, and attracting a number of prominent aristocratic patrons, including the Duke of Manchester (1737-88), the Marquess of Granby (1721-70) and Lord Grosvenor. From 1772 to 1776 Peters travelled once more to France and Italy, where he particularly admired the work of Rubens (1577-1640), Correggio (1494, or 1489-1534) and the contemporary French painter, Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805). On his return, Peters moved into a house belonging to Lord Grosvenor in Millbank. It was then, presumably urged on by Grosvenor and like-minded patrons, that Peters began to paint a series of quasi-erotic character studies of courtesans, including Lydia. These pictures, quite unusual in eighteenth-century British art, are reminiscent of Greuze's sexually charged portrayals of swooning young women, and underline their essentially cosmopolitan appeal.\n\nBy the late 1770s Peters, who was clearly worried about the damage that such works were doing to his reputation as a serious artist, gave up painting courtesan pictures. Indeed, following his ordination in 1781, and his subsequent appointment as Honorary Chaplain to the Royal Academy, he was highly embarrassed by them, expressing a profound regret 'that he ever devoted his talents to such subjects, not only because they were degrading to his character but [also] from sincere moral regret (Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions, p.57). \n\nFurther reading:Tate Gallery.

Brought up in Dublin, where his father was a customs officer. By 1759 he was in London, studying under Thomas Hudson. From c. 1762 Peters travelled and studied in Italy. On his return to London in 1766, he exhibited at the Free Society of Artists two portraits of ladies in native Italian dress (untraced). \nEarly in his career Peters was a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists; later, he was elected ARA (1771) and RA (1778). He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. In mid-life, however, he turned his attention to the Church and was ordained in 1783. He was made rector of Eaton, Leics, and afterwards chaplain to George, Prince of Wales, and to the Royal Academy, from which he resigned in 1790. This respectable and pious later career is somewhat surprising, since the pictures by which Peters made his early name were coquettish half-lengths of under-dressed young women. Highly popular and often engraved, these pictures were also considered slightly risqu\u00e9. In style, Peters broke from the stodginess of his master, Hudson, and equally from the prevailing current of Neo-classicism. His surfaces were rich and painterly, his colours lush and high-keyed. Venice and Correggio meant more to him than Rome and Antiquity. Gradually, his subjects became more decorous. Towards the end of his career as a painter (from which he retired in 1788) he produced a few lugubrious sacred pictures, for example Angel Carrying the Spirit of a Child to Paradise (1782; Burghley House, Cambs).\nBibliographyDNB; Strickland; Waterhouse: 18th C.V.

He was visiting Germany when war was declared and was unable to return to France, but for health reasons he was pronounced unfit for service. To support himself he opened his own art school in 1915. He had relatively few pupils during the war, but as his fame spread after 1918 he attracted students from all over the world. \nIn the 1930s and 1940s Hofmann played an increasingly prominent role in American art, particularly in transmitting modernist theories and new artistic developments. He taught many younger artists who later became established figures. The importance of his own art was for a long time overshadowed by his immense influence as a teacher and theorist, but by the late 1950s he was beginning to be recognised as one of the major figures of Abstract expressionism. \nWithin a few years, however, Hofmann had developed a highly distinctive form of abstraction based on patches of vivid colour, vigorous gestures and textural contrasts. Although the dense surfaces and impulsive application of paint in his works of the 1950s can be associated with action painting, his work was distinguished by a rigorous concern with pictorial structure, spatial illusion and colour relationships. He is admired for his late paintings in which he placed rectangles of single colours against more loosely painted backgrounds to establish dynamic pictorial relationships as well as a strong surface design. \nBibliographyF.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n This is one of four paintings depicting hybrid racehorses which Wallinger made in 1994-5. The paintings are all titled Half Brother with individual subtitles, made up of the names of the two horses from which the halves are taken, in parentheses to distinguish them and share a similar structure. Each consists of two abutting canvases bringing together the two halves of the horse. The horses are painted realistically in thin oil against a white ground. Wallinger derived the horses from photographs in the Jockey Club\u2019s official record of thoroughbred stallions. He projected the photographs onto the large canvases and copied them. In each painting, the horse\u2019s forequarters appear on the left panel and its hindquarters on the right. The bodies\u2019 outlines connect only approximately at the point where the canvases join. Different colouring and variation in build between the horses\u2019 halves result in incongruous blends. In Half Brother (Exit to Nowhere \u2013 Machiavellian) the horse\u2019s head and shoulders are an ochre-brown, turning to black on its forelegs. The rear half of its body is a uniform rich, glossy black, broken only by a narrow white band above its left hoof. The painting\u2019s title reflects on the significance of pedigree in horse breeding while the subtitle directs the work towards a particular reading. In racing terminology, \u2018half brother\u2019 may only be used for animals sharing the same mother. The words \u2018Exit to Nowhere\u2019 suggest that the inbreeding typical to pedigree animals (not only horses) may be ultimately unproductive. The appellation \u2018Machiavellian\u2019, evoking the Italian political philosopher Nicolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) whose name has become synonymous with deviousness and expediency, hints rather ambiguously at cunning. The other subtitles in the series are Jupiter Island \u2013 Precocious (Collection Vanhaerents, Torhout), Diesis - Keen (private collection, Belgium) and Unfuwain \u2013 Nashwan\n(private collection).\n\nHorse-racing and its culture are the subject of much of Wallinger\u2019s work of the early 1990s. He has commented that horse-racing \u2018has an extraordinary aesthetic frisson for me which covers everything from the gambling to the magical identification with the animal on which your money rides to the sheer beauty of the thoroughbred\u2019 (quoted in The Turner Prize, [p.10]). An important precursor to the Half Brother series, Race, Class, Sex 1992 (Saatchi Collection, London) consists of four large canvases depicting four life-sized stallions. Each is a direct descendant of \u2018Eclipse\u2019, a horse painted by George Stubbs (1724-1806) in the eighteenth century. The work\u2019s title connects horse-flesh with human. Like many of the owners of the hunting horses painted by Stubbs in the eighteenth century, race horses have family trees describing their lineage and pedigrees in detail. Union between horses is the result of calculation planned to maximise particular qualities in the breed and is carefully controlled. Wallinger emphasised the political nature of his interest in racehorses with his photographic Self Portrait as Emily Davison 1993 (collection the artist). Dressed as a jockey in the colours (green, violet and white) of the Suffragette Movement, he stood in front of the race-course at the point where the Suffragette Emily Davison died after throwing herself in front of the King\u2019s horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby. In 1994 he extended his interest in the sport to the purchase (through a syndicate) of a yearling filly which he named A Real Work of Art. He explained: \u2018In choosing a racehorse as the subject of the piece I am signalling the fact that the thoroughbred is already an aestheticised thing, its whole purpose being to give pleasure to its owners and followers. Here, beyond representation, was the lost object which I could restore in all its fullness and potential by denoting it as a work of art.\u2019 (Quoted in The Turner Prize, [p.10].) Wallinger completed an MA in Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London in 1985. His use of the notion of controlled breeding or hybridisation to reflect back on the processes of contemporary art recalls the work of Michael-Craig Martin (born 1941), who was teaching on the Fine Art course at Goldsmiths College during the 1980s. In his most famous work, An Oak Tree 1973 (Tate L02262), Craig-Martin used the Catholic rite of transubstantiation as a metaphor for intellectual transformation in conceptual art. This concern with the processes of representation is central to many British artists of Wallinger\u2019s generation.\n\nFurther reading:\nMark Wallinger, exhibition catalogue, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham and Serpentine Gallery, London 1995\nMark Wallinger: Credo, exhibition catalogue, Tate Liverpool 2000, reproduced (colour) p.63\nThe Turner Prize 1995, exhibition brochure, Tate Gallery, London 1995, [pp.10-11] reproduced (colour) [p.11]\n\nElizabeth Manchester\nFebruary 2003\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "1994\u20135", "dimensions": "Displayed: 2300 x 3000 x 35 mm", "reference": "T07038", "title": "Half-Brother (Exit to Nowhere - Machiavellian)", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wallinger-half-brother-exit-to-nowhere-machiavellian-t07038", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07038_8.jpg", "artist": "Mark Wallinger", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1959", "artistbio": "\n English painter, sculptor and video artist. He studied in London at the Chelsea School of Art (1978\u201381) and Goldsmiths College (1983\u20135). From the mid 1980s his work has addressed the traditions and values of British society, its class system and organised religion. The range of approaches he has adopted reflects his wish to have a broad appeal and highlights his roots in a tradition of British left-wing thought. In the early 1990s he began using a personal enthusiasm for horse racing as a theme through which to explore issues of ownership and pedigree.\nIn the late 1990s Wallinger shifted his focus to a questioning of institutionalised spirituality and religion. The skepticism and irreverence of his work, typical of his humorous observational approach, were downplayed in a later public sculpture commissioned for the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square: Ecce Homo (marbleised resin, barbed wire, gold leaf, 1999). Close to the edge of the massive stone plinth, Wallinger placed a life-sized cast of a young man representing Christ being presented by Pontius Pilate to the Judeans. This work suggested contemporary relevance for themes of suffering and redemption, and a plea for racial and religious tolerance. Wallinger has described his approach in terms of the address of the chorus to the audience in classical Greek theatre, suggesting both an authentic absorption and personal investment in the work as well as a real critical distance. Wallinger was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1995. \nBibliographyMark Wallinger (exh. cat., essay J. Thompson, Birmingham, Ikon Gal., 1995)Turner Prize 1995 (exh. cat. V.

A professional model - probably a certain Miss Green - posed for both the girls. Angelo Colarossi, Millet's regular model for male figures, was doubtless used for some of the routine poses for the Puritan, but the facial expression seems to have been taken from Lindsay Macarthur, a Highland landscape artist 'with a sardonic, biting humour, a quick temper and fierce loyalties', who was one of the group of artists living in or near Broadway at the period.

His works are vibrant, technically complex and meticulously executed, consisting of layers of paint, resin, glitter and collage. Ofili often incorporated elephant dung into his work.

His paintings are concerned with issues of black identity and experience and frequently employ racial stereotypes in order to challenge them. Thus in Afrodizzia (1996; London, Saatchi Gal.), the work makes reference to the stereotype of black sexual potency, and magazine cut-out faces are given 1970s Afro hairstyles, their names written in pinheads on lumps of dung. Ofili draws on a wide range of cultural references, from the Bible to jazz and hip hop music, from Blake and Rodin to pornographic magazines. This breadth of allusion is emphatic in the Captain Shit series which features a black superhero inspired by 1970s comic books, surrounded by a band of black stars. The humorous aspect of the depiction of an ostensibly powerful but also vulnerable superhero is recurrent in Ofili's work. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 1998.

During World War I he served on the Western Front, an event that he regarded as epic and imbued with religious, moral and mythic overtones, in which Divine Grace manifested a continual presence. The second experience was his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1921. This immediately led him to join Eric Gill's community at Ditchling, Sussex.\nAt Ditchling, Jones was first taught carpentry and wood-engraving. His engravings were largely for publishers of de luxe illustrated books, and they reveal how he assimilated Gill's influence without imitating his style.\nThe watercolours and occasional oil paintings made by Jones can be divided into three main phases punctuated by his two breakdowns in 1932 and 1947. His early work shows the influence of the spare pseudo-medievalist style practised by Gill.\nAfter his first breakdown, and especially after 1936, Jones began to echo the epic quality of his writing, weaving myth and history around modern commonplace motifs. \nFrom the 1940s until the 1960s Jones also produced inscriptions, at once abstract in form and concrete in relaying biblical and other poetic texts in Latin, Greek, Welsh or English. From c. 1949 until the mid 1950s Jones made an apparent return to his earlier still-lifes in a series of majestic paintings of flowers held within glass chalices.

{"info": "\n \n Summary\n \n \n \n \nThis small-scale oil painting depicts a woman in classical costume seated on a chair with her left elbow resting on a plinth on which a large column stands. Her hands are placed together in front of her, and hold a scroll and a writing implement. To her left is an ornate table with gold legs resembling those of a lion. On the table is a statue of the Roman goddess Minerva and a book.\nThe painting entered the Tate collection in 1967 as a self-portrait of Angelica Kauffmann, and was deemed to have been executed when she retired to Rome in the 1790s. However, in the 1970s this attribution was questioned and an earlier date placing it in the period she was working in Britain (1766\u00bf\u201381) was adopted along with the more general title it now holds. Since then several attempts have been made to identify the sitter. Prominent late eighteenth-century female intellectuals such as the historian Catherine Macaulay (1731\u20131791) and the writer Elizabeth Montagu (1718\u20131800) have been suggested, prompted undoubtedly by the inclusion of the book, scroll, writing implement and statue of Minerva, who was associated with poetry and wisdom. However, the adoption of classical dress and use of classical statues was relatively commonplace for portraits at this time and could have featured in the depiction of any aspiring or would-be intellectual.\nSwiss by birth and Italian by training, Kauffmann arrived in England in 1766 to resounding social and artistic success. The small-scale classical genre works for which she was best known combined serious poetic and historical subject matter with a characteristic lightness of touch and were entirely in tune with the fashionable neoclassical style then being promoted in London. Kauffmann also courted clients with \u2018classicised\u2019 portraits such as this, and executed decorative work for numerous architectural schemes. In recognition of her professional standing, Kauffmann became one of only two female founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768, only a few years prior to completing this painting.\nThe depiction of a female sitter with the accoutrements of learning speaks to developments in women\u2019s education in the second half of the eighteenth century. Perhaps the most prominent manifestation of this was the founding of the celebrated \u2018Bluestocking Society\u2019 by Elizabeth Montagu and Elizabeth Vesey in the 1750s; an informal organisation of predominantly female artists, writers and scholars who gathered together to discuss literature. Kauffmann herself was pictured with several Bluestockings in a group portrait by Richard Samuel, The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain 1778 (National Portrait Gallery, London), which celebrates the country\u2019s artistic and intellectual women.\n\nFurther reading\nAngela Rosenthal, Angelica Kauffman: Art and Sensibility, New Haven and London 2006, p.168.Elizabeth Eger and Lucy Peltz, Brilliant Women: 18th-Century Bluestockings, London 2008.\nRuth Kenny September 2013\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "medium": "Oil paint on canvas", "date": "c.1775", "dimensions": "Frame: 910 x 770 x 70 mm", "reference": "T00928", "title": "Portrait of a Lady", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/kauffman-portrait-of-a-lady-t00928", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00928_8.jpg", "artist": "Angelica Kauffman", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1741\u20131807", "artistbio": "\n Swiss painter and etcher. She was a serious and prolific painter of portraits and one of relatively few women artists painting in the Neo-classical style to specialise in subject pictures as well. She attracted glittering and international patronage (the family of George III in Britain, Grand-Duke Paul and Prince Nikolay Yusupov in Russia, Stanislav II Poniatowski and Stanislav Kostka Potocki in Poland, Queen Caroline of Naples and Emperor Joseph II of Austria) and was much admired by her fellow artists. In Rome she was accepted into the Accademia di S Luca at the precocious age of 23, and in London she was a founder-member of the Royal Academy and an invited participant in virtually every important public project involving painting, from the abortive scheme to decorate St Paul's Cathedral to the decorations for the Royal Academy's own rooms at Somerset House and John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. The final tribute paid to Kauffman in Rome at her funeral, which was arranged by Antonio Canova and attended by representatives from both the Roman and foreign academies, was the carrying along in triumph of two of her own works, in obvious emulation of Raphael's funeral.\n ", "acquisition": "Presented by Mrs M.
