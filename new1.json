He trained at Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore (BA 1976), and worked as a Wall Street commodities broker before embarking upon his career as an artist. In the 1980s he won international recognition as a radical exponent of Neo-Geo, an American movement concerned with appropriation and parody. Following the example of Pop artists of the 1960s, Koons used his work to reflect the commercial systems of the modern world. He also referred back to the Duchampian tradition, appropriating an art status to selected products. His vacuum cleaners encased in perspex (1980\u201381; see 1993 exh. cat., pls 5\u20139) were classified as monuments to sterility. His immaculate replicas of domestic products, advertisements, kitsch toys and models exercised an enthusiastic endorsement of unlimited consumption, unlike the veiled criticism of some work of the first generation of Pop artists. Koons perceived Western civilisation as a driven society, flattered by narcissistic images and with a voracious appetite for glamorous commodities. In his expressions of the ecstatic and the banal he did not hesitate to breach the borderlines of taste; in the body of work titled Made in Heaven (1989\u201391; see 1993 exh. cat., pls 48\u201365) he featured explicit sexual photographs and models of himself with his wife Ilona Staller (\u2018La Cicciolina'). Such works were naturally highly controversial.\nBibliographyHigh &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture (exh. cat. by K. Varnedoe and A. Gopnik, New York, MOMA; Chicago, IL, A.

These were made by cutting or tearing shapes from paper which had been painted with gouache. The shapes were placed and pasted down by an assistant working under Matisse's instruction. Some of the later ones, such as The Snail, were of very large dimensions. The technique, explored in his picture book Jazz (published 1947) and other works, opened up new possibilities for him. Matisse said of the technique that it 'allows me to draw in the colour. It is a simplification for me. Instead of drawing the outline and putting the colour inside it - the one modifying the other - I draw straight into the colour' (quoted in Amis de l'art, October 1951). \n\nHis secretary Mme Lydia Delectorskaya described the making of The Snail (letter to the Tate Gallery, 30 March 1976): \n\nThe Snail was made in the H\u00f4tel R\u00e9gina at Nice. H. Matisse had at his disposal sheets of paper painted in gouache by assistants, in all the colours he used for the 'papiers d\u00e9coup\u00e9s'. A background of white paper - of the dimensions indicated by H.M. - was put on the wall and the assistant pinned onto it the pieces of gouached paper which H.M. passed to him indicating exactly where they should be placed. When H.M. decided that his composition was finished, it was lightly stuck to the background. The panel was taken down when H.M. needed the wall for a further work. When later on it was sent to Lefebvre-Foinet [in Paris] to be pasted down, before anything was moved, an extremely precise tracing was made to ensure that no changes were made in the composition, not even by so much as a millimetre. \n\nMatisse's daughter Mme Duthuit said that her father made many drawings of snails at this time and that the idea for this work came out of these. The concentric pattern formed by the coloured shapes in the centre of the work echoes the spiral pattern found in the snail's shell. Matisse told Andr\u00e9 Verdet (pp.64-5), 'I first of all drew the snail from nature, holding it. I became aware of an unrolling, I found an image in my mind purified of the shell, then I took the scissors'. He has combined pairs of complementary colours - red/green, orange/blue, yellow/mauve - to create a particularly vibrant effect. He gave the picture the alternative title La Composition Chromatique [Chromatic Composition]. \n\nFurther reading:Andr\u00e9 Verdet, Prestiges de Matisse, Paris 1952, pp.64-5John Jacobus, Henri Matisse, London 1973, p.180, reproduced p.154 in colourRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, London 1981, pp.500-02, reproduced p.500 \n\nTerry RiggsFebruary 1998 \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Gouache on paper, cut and pasted on paper mounted on canvas", "dimensions": "Support: 2864 x 2870 mm", "reference": "T00540", "title": "The Snail", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/matisse-the-snail-t00540", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00540_8.jpg", "artist": "Henri Matisse", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1869\u20131954", "date": "1953", "acquisition": "Purchased with assistance from the Friends of the Tate Gallery 1962"},

They date the Tate's drawing and the other early studies 1905-6 and the studies for 'The Watering-Place' (or 'Chevaux au Bain') spring-summer 1906. \n\nThough this watercolour has generally been known in recent years as 'Jeune Homme et Cheval', it was exhibited at the Stafford Gallery in 1912 as 'Cheval avec Jeune Homme en Bleu' (and was priced at \u00a322, the most expensive item in the exhibition). The identification is confirmed by the review in the Athen\u00e6um, 27 April 1912, p.478: '... in Cheval avec jeune Homme en Bleu (5) the horse is quite comic, from the way in which, by an exaggeration of Van Dyck's formula, its forequarters and the pose of the head suggest exactly the action of shrinking self-conscious modesty of the \"Venus de Medici\". The drawing of the figure, on the other hand, is firm and elastic, with a considerable grip on reality.' \n\nPublished in:\nRonald Alley, Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists, Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp.593-4, reproduced p.593 \n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Watercolour and gouache on paper", "dimensions": "Support: 498 x 321 mm", "reference": "N04721", "title": "Horse with a Youth in Blue", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-horse-with-a-youth-in-blue-n04721", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N04/N04721_8.jpg", "artist": "Pablo Picasso", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1881\u20131973", "date": "1905\u20136", "acquisition": "Bequeathed by C.

She was drawn into the movement\u2019s orbit through her relationship with Max Ernst (1891-1976), developing her own richly individual imagery that grew out of her childhood obsessions (see also I am an Amateur of Velocipedes T11910). In the period 1937-41, added impetus came from the tensions engendered by Ernst\u2019s rejected wife, Marie-Berthe Aurenche, and then by his imprisonment on the declaration of war. Escaping occupied France, Carrington crossed into Spain in a state of mental collapse and eventually reached Portugal in 1941, only to encounter Ernst travelling with the American collector Peggy Guggenheim to New York.\n\nDo you know my Aunt Eliza? includes one of Carrington\u2019s central images: the horse. The robed and horse-headed figure with a crucifix towers over a sinister accomplice. The imagery is ambiguous, as Carrington often used the horse as a sign of \u2018dynamism and speed and sovereignty\u2019, as Marina Warner has observed (Warner 1989, p.2). This aspect is seen most notably in her major early painting The Inn of the Dawn Horse 1936-7 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, reproduced in Aberth 2004, p.31), but also in the frozen horse in Portrait of Max Ernst 1939 (reproduced in Aberth 2004, p.43), whose pose, incidentally, anticipates that in Do you know my Aunt Eliza? One recent commentator has added that the horse was \u2018multi-determined\u2019, representing for Carrington \u2018her access to the invisible world, the sustenance of her internal reality, and the energy that provides her with the impetus to transcend the irrationality of the human world\u2019 (Salomon Grimberg, \u2018Leonora Carrington and Julien Levy\u2019, in Tribute to Julien Levy, auction catalogue, Tajan, Paris, October 2004, opposite lots 482-5). In Do you know my Aunt Eliza?, however, the atmosphere is darkly threatening, the horse\u2019s eyeless gaze is matched by the blind stare of its human accomplice. In the context of the artist\u2019s lapsed Catholicism, this image recalls the biting parody of religion found in Francisco Goya (1746-1828), whose bleak etchings may also be remembered in the dense hatching of this drawing. Related drawings, including an untitled image which evokes a witches coven (Tribute to Julien Levy 2004, lot 458), reinforce this association.\n\nIt has been inferred, from the quality of the materials and the finish, that the ink drawings (of which I am an Amateur of Velocipedes is another), were made once Carrington had reached New York in 1941 (Grimberg 2004). They evidently relate closely to more hurried pencil sketches made as part of Carrington\u2019s therapy under Dr Morales in Santander in 1940. The horse image appears in many of these with a similar ambiguity, oscillating between nightmare and self-identification. The artist relived her breakdown in the searing novel Down Below (1943, republished in Carrington 1989, pp.163-209), but a note to her father (that at one time accompanied the sketches) gives, with raw immediacy, a sense of the collapse: \u2018It is difficult for you to imagine what very hard work it is to reconstruct a complete nervous wreck ... I think you had better know that I have been very close to lunacy\u2019 (Tribute to Julien Levy 2004, lot 694).\n\nThe question that serves as this drawing\u2019s title is inscribed on the back. Just as with I am an Amateur of Velocipedes, it can be related to Carrington\u2019s story Little Francis (republished in Carrington 1989, pp.163-209). This tells of the destructive rivalry for Uncle Ubriaco\u2019s affection between Amelia, his daughter, and her cousin Francis. These characters thinly disguise Marie-Berthe, Ernst and Carrington herself, the conflict that, in part at least, precipitated her breakdown. The central passages, which focuses on Francis (the Carrington figure), concern his attempts to retain Ubriaco. On being forced to move-on by the immanent arrival of Amelia, he sings \u2018rather dejectedly\u2019, while cycling (Carrington 1989, p.110):\n\n\nDo you know my Aunt Eliza? Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\n\nShe is blue but don\u2019t despise her. Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\n\nNow you\u2019ll excuse me laughing like I\u2019m inclined to do \u2013\n\nBut, do you know my Aunt Eliza? Wha, ha, ha, ha, haa.\n\n\n\nThis curious ditty goes without explanation in the text. Recalling the nursery rhymes of childhood, in which Carrington saw parallels to Surrealist concerns, it bears a sense of deeply concealed meanings. It is notable that Francis sprouts a horse\u2019s head when Ubriaco returns to Amelia. This seems to allude to the white rocking horse that Carrington had kept in the Parisian flat she shared with Ernst, while also being a physical sign of dejection and abandonment.\n\n\nFurther reading:\nMarina Warner, \u2018Introduction\u2019, in Leonora Carrington, The House of Fear: Notes from Down Below, London 1989.\nAndrea Schlieker ed., Leonora Carrington: Paintings, Drawings and Sculptures 1940-1990, exhibition catalogue, Serpentine Gallery, London 1991.\nSusan L.

In the pantheon of heroes of the Modern Movement, he has been elevated to a cult figure, such that the importance of his late 19th-century background and training in Glasgow are often overlooked. He studied during a period of great artistic activity in the city that produced the distinctive Glasgow style. As a follower of A. W. N. Pugin and John Ruskin, he believed in the superiority of Gothic over Classical architecture and by implication that moral integrity in architecture could be achieved only through revealed construction. Although Mackintosh's buildings refrain from overt classicism, they reflect its inherent discipline. His profound originality was evident by 1895, when he began the designs for the Glasgow School of Art. His decorative schemes, particularly the furniture, also formed an essential element in his buildings. During Mackintosh's lifetime his influence was chiefly felt in Austria, in the work of such painters as Gustav Klimt and such architects as Josef Hoffmann and Joseph Maria Olbrich. The revival of interest in his work was initiated by the publication of monographs by Pevsner (1950) and Howarth (1952). The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society was formed in Glasgow in 1973; it publishes a biannual newsletter, has a reference library and organises exhibitions. The Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, holds the Mackintosh estate of drawings, watercolours and archival material as well as a collection of his furniture; the Glasgow School of Art and the Glasgow Art Gallery also have important collections.\n                ", "date": "c.1927", "acquisition": "Presented by Walter W.

She trained at the Slade School of Fine Art. There she met the English painter Victor Willing (1928\u201388) They continued to divide their time between Portugal and England until 1975. She first won acclaim in Portugal with semi-abstract paintings that sometimes included collage elements culled from her own drawings. Their satiric wit and verve of line, sometimes applied to violent or political subjects revealed gifts for story-telling that had been awakened in her as a child by folk-tales related by a great-aunt.\nIn 1976 Rego returned to London with her husband, and in the late 1970s she turned from collage to drawing directly in acrylic on paper. Using an essentially graphic style reminiscent of comic strips, she continued to produce figurative pictures that were spontaneous narratives rather than illustrations to literary texts. Her characters often took the form of animals for satirical effect. She developed a greater freedom and range of colour in her drawings, which inclined them more towards painting. In 1986 she turned to a naturalistic idiom with strongly modelled figures and a consistent light source, often in interior settings as in Snare (1987; Brit. Council Col.); similar subjects were treated in prints which effectively combined etched outlines with tonal gradations of aquatint. These psychologically charged presentations of human dramas, based in part on childhood memories, won her a wide and admiring audience. In 1989 her largest painting to that date, The Dance (2.13\u00d72.74m), was bought by the Tate.\nBibliographyPaula Rego (exh. cat. by A. de Lacerda, Lisbon, Soc. N.

Bacon repeatedly ran away from his school in Cheltenham (1924-6). After his authoritarian father, repelled by his burgeoning homosexuality, threw him out of the family home for wearing his mother\u2019s clothes, Bacon arrived in London in 1926 with little schooling but with a weekly allowance of \u00a33 from his mother. \n\u00a0\nIn 1927 Bacon travelled to Berlin (frequenting the city\u2019s homosexual night-clubs) and Paris. He was impressed by Picasso\u2019s 1927 exhibition (Galerie Paul Rosenberg) and began to draw and paint while attending the free Academies. Returning to London in the following year, he established himself (and his childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot) at Queensbury Mews West, South Kensington. He worked as a furniture and interior designer in the modernist style of Eileen Gray and exhibited his designs there in 1929. These were featured in the Studio1 before he shared a second studio show with the painters Jean Shepeard and Roy de Maistre (Nov. 1930). An early patron was the businessman, Eric Hall, who would became Bacon\u2019s lover and supporter (c.1934- c.1950). As well as designing, Bacon continued to paint with de Maistre as an important influence and practical guide on matters of technique. The results showed the impact of Jean Lur\u00e7at and Picasso, and a Crucifixion shown at the Mayor Gallery in 1933 was juxtaposed with a Picasso in Herbert Read\u2019s Art Now and bought by the collector Sir Michael Sadler. In the following year, the painter organised his first solo exhibition in the basement of a friend\u2019s house (Sunderland House, Curzon Street) renamed \u2018Transition Gallery\u2019 for the purpose, but it was not well received and he responded by destroying the paintings. His works were rejected by Read for the International Surrealist Exhibition (1936), but Bacon and de Maistre helped Hall to organise Young British Painters (Agnew and Sons, Jan. 1937), which included Graham Sutherland, Victor Pasmore and others.\n\u00a0\nWith the coming of war in 1939, Bacon was exempt from military service and released by the ARP on account of his asthma. He spent 1941 painting in Hampshire, before returning to London where he met Lucian Freud and was close to Sutherland. From these years emerged the works which he later considered as the beginning of his career, pre-eminently the partial bodies of Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, 1944 (Tate Gallery N06171) which was first shown at the Lefevre Gallery (April 1945) to unease and acclaim alike. Bacon became central to an artistic milieu in post-war Soho, which included Lucian Freud, Michael Andrews, the photographer John Deakin, Henrietta Moraes, Isabel Rawsthorne and others. On Sutherland\u2019s recommendation Erica Brausen secured the painter\u2019s contract with the Hanover Gallery and sold Painting 1946 to the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1948. Bacon gambled away the results at Monte Carlo and, as homosexuality remained illegal, his lifestyle in London and France was tinged with the illicit.\n\u00a0\nThe early 1950s saw a period of success and rootlessness following the death of Jessie Lightfoot. Bacon\u2019s first post-war solo exhibition included the first of many works inspired by Velazquez\u2019s Portrait of Pope Innocent X, 1650 (Galleria Doria Pamphili, Rome) and showed his use of characteristic enclosing frameworks (Hanover Gallery, December 1951 \u2013 February 1952); it was followed by his New York debut (Durlacher Gallery, October 1953). The paintings of Popes, which established his reputation, alternated with those of contemporary figures in suits who were similarly entrapped; however, following a trip to Egypt and South Africa (1950) a lighter tonality emerged in paintings of sphinxes and of animals. During this period, Peter Lacey became Bacon\u2019s lover and inspired homoerotic images of wrestlers derived from Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s photographs in Animal Locomotion (Philadelphia 1887), Animals in Motion (London 1899) and The Human Figure in Motion (London 1901); the photographs became a habitual source, just as the theme of sexual encounter persisted. In Italy in 1954, Bacon avoided seeing Velazquez\u2019s Pope Innocent X in Rome and his own paintings at the Venice Biennale, where he shared the British pavilion with Ben Nicholson and Freud. Two years later, he visited Lacey in Tangiers, and met the American writers William Burroughs and Paul Bowles, and the painter Ahmed Yacoubi; Bacon subsequently returned regularly until Lacey\u2019s death in 1962. \n\u00a0\nThe exhibition of paintings after Van Gogh (Hanover Gallery, 1957) marked the sudden departure from the preceding monochromatic works towards heightened colour. Despite their success, in the following year the painter transferred dealer to Marlborough Fine Art; they paid off his growing gambling debts, mounted larger exhibitions and ensured that he destroyed fewer canvases. In 1961, Bacon settled in Reece Mews, South Kensington, where he remained for the rest of his life, and in the following year the Tate Gallery organised a major touring retrospective which saw the resumption of his use of the triptych which would become his characteristic format. At that time he recorded the first of the interviews with the critic David Sylvester which would constitute the canonical text on his own work.\n\u00a0\nIn 1963-4, Bacon\u2019s international reputation was confirmed with his retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1963) and by the publication of Ronald Alley\u2019s catalogue raison\u00e9e. He refused the Carnegie Institute Award (1967) and donated the Rubens Prize towards the restorations following the flood of Florence. On the eve of Bacon\u2019s large retrospective at the Grand Palais in Paris (1971), his long-time lover George Dyer committed suicide and this event left haunting echoes in ensuing paintings. However in 1974, John Edwards became the painter\u2019s companion and model. \n\u00a0\nIn the 1970s Bacon travelled regularly to New York and Paris, where he bought a pied-\u00e0-terre, and publications helped to establish the popular image of his work as a reflection of the anxiety of the modern condition. International exhibitions became more wide-ranging: Marseilles (1976), Mexico and Caracas (1977), Madrid and Barcelona (1978), Tokyo (1983). They reinforced the perception of Bacon as the greatest British painter since J.M.W. Turner. His works from this period were dominated by the triptych, but the figures grew calmer and were set against flat expanses of colour. In isolated images without a human presence, an animal power was retained in segments of dune and waste land. The exhibitions culminated in a second Tate retrospective (1985, travelling to Stuttgart and Berlin), and shows in Moscow (1988) - a sign of post-Communist liberalism - and Washington (1989). On a visit to Madrid in 1992, Bacon was hospitalised with pneumonia exacerbated by asthma and died on 28 April.\n\u00a0\nBibliography:\nRonald Alley and John Rothenstein, Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 and Documentation, London 1964\nJohn Russell, Francis Bacon, London, Paris and Berlin 1971, 2nd ed.

He devoted\nmuch of his life to painting the local landscape, the scenes of his 'careless boyhood' which, he said, 'made me a painter' (in R.B. Beckett, ed., John Constable's Correspondence, VI, Ipswich 1968, p.78). He went to work for his father in\nthe family business about 1792. In 1794 he made a sketching tour of Norfolk. He made his first etchings in 1797. In 1799 Constable was introduced to Joseph Farington, RA, and entered the Royal Academy Schools. He visited Staffordshire and Derbyshire in\n1801. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1802. He received a commission in 1805 to paint an altarpiece for the church at Brantham. He toured the Lake District in 1806. In 1810 he began work for an altarpiece for Nayland Church.Constable began\nto see his future wife, Maria Bicknell (see Maria Bicknell, Mrs John Constable, 1816 Tate Gallery N02655) regularly from 1809, although they had met some years earlier. They married in 1816, despite\nopposition from her family, and eventually had seven children. They moved to Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, London in 1817. From 1819, because of his wife's ill health, Constable rented a house for his family at Hampstead, making about a hundred studies of\ncloud formations, many oil sketches of Hampstead views, and several 'finished' works on the spot (see Hampstead Heath, with the House Called 'The Salt Box', c.1819-20, Tate Gallery N01236).\nThey lived in Joseph Farington's former house in Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury from 1822. In 1824 they began going to Brighton for reasons of Maria's health. She died of tuberculosis in 1828. In a letter to his brother Golding of 19 December, Constable\nwrote, 'I shall never feel again as I have felt, the face of the World is totally changed to me' (in C.R. Leslie, ed. A. Shirley, Memoirs of the Life of John Constable, R.A., London 1937, p.234).Constable exhibited regularly at the British\nInstitution from 1808, at the Liverpool Academy 1813-14, at the Birmingham Society of Arts from 1829, and at the Worcester Institution 1834-6. He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1819, and a Royal Academician in 1829. The Hay-Wain\n(1820-1, National Gallery, London) was one of three of his works shown at the Paris Salon in 1824 and earned him a gold medal from Charles X. In 1826 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society of Fine Arts, Lille, France, following exhibits at its\nSalon. Friendship with the Fisher family, especially Archdeacon John Fisher, took him to Salisbury in 1811, 1820, 1823 and 1829. The first edition of English Landscape, a series of prints after his work by David Lucas, was published 1830-2.\nBetween 1833 and 1836 Constable lectured on landscape painting at the Royal Institution, the Hampstead Literary and Scientific Society, and the Worcester Athenaeum. He visited West Sussex in 1834 and 1835. He died in Bloomsbury, and was buried in the\nchurchyard of St John's, Hampstead.Further reading:C.R. Leslie, ed.

This title was derived from a detail of one of the collages in the group, \u2018Evadne in Green Dimension\u2019 1952, which contains the printed word \u2018BUNK!\u2019. In the catalogue of his Tate Gallery retrospective in 1971, the artist states beside a reproduction of this collage (p. 49) that this word gave the title to the lecture he gave at the Independent Group. This lecture, at the premises of the I.C.A. in London in 1952, was the first event to be presented in the programme of the Independent Group. Its main feature was the projection by Paolozzi through an epidiascope of a large number of images mainly removed from magazines and including material from science fiction, aviation, technology, comics, advertising for food, domestic appliances, cars, films, etc., pin-up pictures, news photographs and medical diagrams. Although many of the images projected were whole pages from magazines, untampered with except by the act of isolation, the artist told the compiler that the collages from \u2018Bunk\u2019 were among the material that was projected.\nIn 1972, reproductions of forty-five of the \u2018Bunk\u2019 collages were published by Snail Chemicals (Publishing), in two editions comprising a total of 170 sets. The ten images of which the original collages are in the Tate Gallery have the following numbers in this portfolio: T01458 (9); T01459 (10); T01460 (15); T01461 (22); T01462 (25); T01463 (33); T01464 (36); T01465 (43); T01466 (6); T01467 (4).\nIn the introductory essay to the \u2018Bunk\u2019 suite, (loc. cit.), Frank Whitford has written: \u2018Bunk occupies a crucial position in Paolozzi\u2019s own development. It is the strongest link between his past and his present. For the kind of imagery he collaged and collected here during the late 1940\u2019s has recurred with marked regularity throughout his work\u2026 Bunk is ... a much-thumbed source-book and the key to many of Paolozzi\u2019s otherwise arcane ideas.\u2019\nPaolozzi\u2019s note of the date of each \u2018Bunk\u2019 collage was printed beside its reproduction in the catalogue of his 1971 Tate Gallery retrospective. He explained to the compiler how each of the very strong images was clearly linked in his memory with specific dateable events such as exhibitions, his return to London from Paris, or different periods of his work as a teacher. In conversation with the compiler (20 July 1971) Nigel Henderson recalled being shown the \u2018Bunk\u2019 collages by Paolozzi in the 1940\u2019s and early 1950\u2019s before the Independent Group lecture.\nThe collages were executed in scrapbooks, in which they remained until shortly before Paolozzi\u2019s 1971 retrospective. It has not been possible to trace whether the particular scrapbooks containing \u2018Bunk\u2019 collages were ever exhibited as scrapbooks.\nSince childhood, Paolozzi had compulsively filled scrapbooks. In the text of a monograph on Paolozzi to be published in 1973, Frank Whitford identifies influences on Paolozzi subsequent to childhood which joined with this compulsion to stimulate the creation of the \u2018Bunk\u2019 collages. Primary among these was the strong impact on Paolozzi of Surrealism, especially when he was in Paris in 1947\u201349. At Mary Reynolds\u2019s house there he saw a wide range of collaged material including collages by Duchamp from material in the National Geographic Magazine. He was influenced by the collages of Ernst and, through magazines, by those of John Heartfield. The impact of these art influences fused with that of American magazines; Paolozzi acquired these from American G.I.\u2019s in Europe, and from East End shops in London (including S. Lavner\u2019s in Bethnal Green Road, photographed by Nigel Henderson circa 1950\u201351), he got sex and cinema magazines, and comics. In the \u2018Bunk\u2019 suite introductory essay (loc. cit.) Frank Whitford wrote that through American magazines Paolozzi \u2018realised that, say, food and automobile ads spoke more eloquently and economically of dreams than any conventional art was able to do\u2019.\nThe title of each collage in \u2018Bunk\u2019 was designated by Paolozzi in 1972. He told the compiler that the collage element containing the word \u2018Pop!\u2019 in T01462 came from the packet of a toy gun. The circle-enclosed brand name \u2018Real Gold\u2019 which gives its title to T01460 (in which it occurs twice) is also one of the collage elements in T01462. The collage elements in T01466 are placed on a Mir\u00f3 reproduction which Paolozzi identified to the compiler as having been taken from a copy of Verve that he was given before he went to Paris in 1947.\nIn conversation with the compiler he also affirmed that at the time when he was engaged in it he saw the activity of making the collages in \u2018Bunk\u2019 as that of making-art. In any or all of its aspects of selection, retention, isolation, juxtaposition and re-presentation, he saw his continuous activity of taking material from the mass media as an implicit assertion of the impossibility of making a positive distinction between art and life. In the introduction to \u2018Bunk\u2019 (loc. cit.) Frank Whitford writes: \u2018as Bunk is intended to show, the source material is not only raw material, it is also already art. And Paolozzi could never discuss its fascination with elaborate, ornate or any other kind of superficial seriousness. For, unlike the mandarins, he cannot view it from the outside. It is already part of him, much more his culture than Michelangelo, Raphael or C\u00e9zanne.\u2019 In the text of his forthcoming monograph on Paolozzi, Whitford adds: \u2018Paolozzi has always been an intuitive artist, playing his hunches. He has always worked first and analysed his motives second. He reacted to the ad and magazine imagery as strongly and as emotionally as he had done to cigarette cards and pictures of footballers he had copied as a child. But the difference now was that the Surrealists had taught him that such ephemeral images, the stuff of dreams, need not necessarily be transformed by an artistic imagination to become art, and that it was better to work with what thrilled him as an artist than consciously to work within a respectable artistic tradition and only use what convention taught was permissible.\u2019\nPublished in The Tate Gallery Report 1970\u20131972, London 1972.\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Printed papers on card", "dimensions": "Support: 356 x 264 mm", "reference": "T01466", "title": "Sack-o-sauce", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-sack-o-sauce-t01466", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T01/T01466_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Eduardo Paolozzi", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1924\u20132005", "date": "1948", "acquisition": "Presented by the artist 1971"},

She has numbered the pages in pencil at the top right hand corner. The text recounts, in note form, the significant events of Emin's life, beginning with conception (together with her twin brother) 'in Ireland 1962', up until 1995. These events include her education and professional trajectory, as is usual in a curriculum vitae, as well as more personal experiences and her feelings about them. Mixing her sexual experiences and emotional reactions with her training as an artist and the achievement of qualifications, Emin suggests that all these elements have equal importance in the making of 'Tracey Emin' (the public persona). This proposes emotional experience as part of her qualifications to be an artist and at the same time transforms the curriculum vitae, from which such material is usually omitted, into a more rounded self-portrait. Since her self-published book Exploration of the Soul 1994 (an edition of 200), in which she recounted her life from conception to rape at the age of thirteen, Emin has consistently based her art on the story of her life. In a manner similar to her book, Emin's CV offers the allegedly authentic recounting of the artist's life as the artwork itself. \n\nThe reconciliation of life and art is a particularly overt tension in the narrative of Emin's CV. After beginning but not completing a fashion diploma at Medway College of Design (she wrote 'was advised to go see a pshciotrist [sic] - as I was condemning myself to life on the dole - '), Emin did a foundation course at John Cass School of Art in London, where she learnt print-making two days a week. In 1983 she was offered a place at Maidstone College of Art where she spent '3 of the happy 1st [sic] years of my life - learning so much so quickly - leave in LOVE with EDVARD MUNCH - and a First Class honours degree'. This seminal period of artistic enlightenment is followed by a passionate and drunken interlude with a married Turkish fisherman eighteen years her senior (in Turkey) before she went to the Royal College of Art in London for two years of further art education. This did not live up to expectations and Emin describes the period as: 'Absolutely amazing - after all that I'd been through - I'd say - these were the worst two years of my life - '. The text then moves to the end of an abusive relationship, after which Emin concludes: 'A victim no more - weak sad time of life - no self respect - too poor'. But things get worse as she becomes pregnant in 1990 and has an abortion that 'went wrong', followed by a second abortion in 1992 done 'without heart'. The narrative climax is reached at the bottom of page seven: 'middle 1992 - commited [sic] emotion suiside [sic]' and explained on the following page: 'Emotional suiside [sic] - is killing your self - without dying - destroyed each - friendship + relationship - one - by one - till I was alone - destroyed all my art - left my studio - through [sic] away my curtains - my carpet - my cusions [sic] - my comfort - made my home a cell - + waited -'. Despair is followed, in typical Emin fashion, by the beginnings of her public recognition as an artist as she starts to conceptualise her expressive potential and is signed up by White Cube gallery in London in 1993. \n\nThe artist's self-portrait provided by Emin's CV is consistently ambiguous. In the early pages Emin describes her rape down an alley at the age of thirteen, followed swiftly by the onset of puberty (graphically described through the growth of body hair) and the discovery of the pleasure of sex described as 'fantastic' and 'wonderful' as well as the artist's appetite for it ('shag - shag - shag' and 'bang - bang - bang'). This is accompanied by an account of being kicked in the face and suffering other humiliations from a pair of males, who expose and ridicule her genitals. Her relationship with artist, poet and musician Billy Childish (born 1959) is thus described as 'distruction [sic] resurrection'. As in her video Why I Never Became A Dancer 1995 (Tate T07314), the artist documents her abuse by men and then redeems it through her trajectory of learning not to be 'a victim'. Like many of her works, Emin's CV is simultaneously a means for the artist to exorcise her humiliation and, literally, to transform traumatic past events into something positive. This creative attitude is encapsulated in the words she appliqu\u00e9ed on a chair she inherited from her grandmother in 1994: 'It's not what you inherit. It's what you do with your inheritance.'  \n\nTracey Emin CV is accompanied by a video, Tracey Emin CV Cunt Vernacular 1997 (Tate T07633), the sound-track of which is Emin reading her CV aloud.\n\nFurther reading:Neal Brown, Sarah Kent, Matthew Collings, Tracey Emin: I Need Art Like I Need God, exhibition catalogue, Jay Jopling/White Cube, London 1998Stuart Morgan, 'The Story of I: Interview with Tracey Emin', Frieze, issue 34, May 1997, pp.56-61Lynn Barber, Gregor Muir, Robert Preece, 'Tracey Emin',  Parkett, issue 63, 2001, pp.22-63\n\nElizabeth ManchesterFebruary 2002\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Ink on paper", "dimensions": "Support: 296 x 209 mm", "reference": "T07632", "title": "Tracey Emin C.V.", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/emin-tracey-emin-cv-t07632", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07632_8.jpg", "artist": "Tracey Emin", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " born 1963", "date": "1995", "acquisition": "Presented by Stuart and Margaret Evans 2000"},

The book has around thirty off-white, hand-made pages with torn edges featuring horizontal streaks of light-brown mud. On some pages the mud streaks are thicker and darker while on others they are thinner and more mottled, evoking rivulets across the pages.\nLong created the pages of this book by dipping sheets of paper into silty wet mud taken from the River Avon in Bristol. He then hung up each sheet to allow the water to run off, leaving streaks of dried mud on its surface. These papers were then hand-bound into a book. The artist has explained:\n\nI think the first mud work on paper was River Avon Book of 1979, where I had the idea to make this book with the pages dipped in muddy water. So I got all these sheets, quite big sheets, and after they had been dipped in the muddy water they were cut down and bound into these books. That was the first time I used paper with mud on it.\n(Elliot 2006, p.51.)\n\nAlthough he has also worked with mud taken from other rivers, Long frequently uses mud from the River Avon and has even taken it abroad for use in exhibitions. Referring to the Avon as his \u2018home\u2019 river \u2013 since it runs through Bristol, where he was born \u2013 Long says:\n\nMy first natural playground was the cliff of the Avon Gorge and the towpath by the river. So even as a kid I was fascinated by the enormous tide, and the mud banks, and the wash of the boats as they swept past. You have this wash sweeping up the mud \u2026 muddy creeks \u2026 I guess it\u2019s right to say that I have used that experience in my art: like water, the tides, the mud. All that cosmic energy is there in my work.\n(Ben Tufnell (ed.), Richard Long: Selected Statements &amp; Interviews, London 2007, p.112.)\n\n\nRiver Avon Book is unique due to the method of its creation, but Long used the same technique to create an edition of 106. Another book in the edition is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Tate curator Andrew Wilson has noted of this edition that \u2018in holding this book you literally hold the river \u2026 the pace of the turning pages akin to the shifting currents. Each page of each book is thus a unique and real image and each book is different from another as is each page, one from another\u2019 (Andrew Wilson in Wallis 2009, p.199). Long has used a similar \u2018mud drawing\u2019 technique for other works, such as River Avon Mud Drawings, Ten Mud-Dipped Papers 1988 (Tate AR00616) and Untitled 1991 (Tate T06555).\n\nFurther reading\nAnne Seymour, Richard Long: Old World, New World, London 1988, p.59.Patrick Elliot, Richard Long: Walking and Marking, exhibition catalogue, National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh 2006, p.51.Clarrie Wallis, Richard Long: Heaven and Earth, exhibition catalogue, Tate Britain, London 2009, p.199.\nRuth BurgonJanuary 2012\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Book with mud on paper", "dimensions": "Object: 158 x 142 x 10 mm", "reference": "AR00144", "title": "River Avon Book", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/long-river-avon-book-ar00144", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/AR/AR00144_8.jpg", "artist": "Richard Long", "collection": "\n        Tate / ", "artistlife": " born 1945", "date": "1979", "acquisition": "ARTIST ROOMS"},

She trained in sculpture at Leeds School of Art (1920-1) and, on a county scholarship, at the Royal College of Art (1921-4), meeting the painters Raymond Coxon and Edna Ginesi and the sculptor Henry Moore. Hepworth was runner-up to John Skeaping for the 1924 Prix de Rome, but travelled to Florence on a West Riding Travel Scholarship. After visiting Rome and Siena with Skeaping, they were married in Florence on 13 May 1925 and moved to Rome, where both began carving stone. In November 1926, they returned to London. Links forged through the British School at Rome with the sculptor Richard Bedford (a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum), ensured that the collector George Eumorfopoulos visited their studio show in 1927 and bought two Hepworths. The couple moved to 7 The Mall Studios in Hampstead in 1928 (where Hepworth remained until 1939). With Bedford and Moore, they became leading figures in the 'new movement' associated with direct carving. Successful joint exhibitions in 1928 (Beaux Arts Gallery, London and Alex. Reid and Lefevre, Glasgow) and 1930 (Tooth's) consisted of animal and figure sculptures in stone and wood. They joined the London Group and the 7 &amp; 5 Society in 1930-1. A son, Paul, was born in August 1929, but the marriage was deteriorating and in 1931 Hepworth met Ben Nicholson (then married to Winifred Nicholson), who joined her on holiday at Happisburgh, Norfolk. She and Skeaping were amicably divorced in 1933. In 1934 Hepworth gave birth to triplets; she married Nicholson four years later.\nHepworth and Nicholson revealed their move towards abstraction in joint exhibitions in 1932 (Tooth's) and 1933 (Lefevre). This became the abiding direction of her work, epitomised by the pioneering piercing of the block, and coincided with experiments in collage, photograms and prints. Establishing links with the continental avant garde, the couple visited the Parisian studios of Arp, Brancusi, Mondrian, Braque and Picasso. They joined Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation, and were major figures in Paul Nash's Unit One grouping and the associated publication edited by Herbert Read (1934). In 1935 they were instrumental in restricting the 7&amp;5 to abstract work, thus paving the way for a fertile period of constructivism enhanced by artist refugees from totalitarian Europe (Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, Breuer, Gabo). This culminated in the publication of Circle: International Survey of Constructive Art (1937), edited by Nicholson, Gabo and the architect Leslie Martin, and designed by Hepworth and Sadie Martin. \n  Such utopianism was curtailed by the war, and Hepworth and Nicholson evacuated to St Ives, Cornwall. They stayed with Margaret Mellis and Adrian Stokes at Little Park Owles, Carbis Bay. Domestic demands and lack of space restricted Hepworth to small sculpture and painting until, on moving to Chy-an-Kerris, Carbis Bay in 1942, she secured a studio. Her first major solo exhibition (Temple Newsam, Leeds 1943) was followed by a monograph by William Gibson (Barbara Hepworth: Sculptress, 1946). She was prominent amongst St Ives artists, forming a focus in 1949 for the establishment of the Penwith Society of Artists with Nicholson, Peter Lanyon and others, and helping to attract international attention to the group's exhibitions. Although Hepworth's contribution to the 1950 Venice Biennale was dogged by comparisons with Moore, two retrospectives - in Wakefield (1951) and London (Whitechapel 1954) - and Read's monograph (1952) confirmed her post-war reputation. She bought Trewyn Studio, St Ives in 1949, where she lived after her divorce from Nicholson two years later. She visited Greece in 1954 in an effort to recover from the sudden death of Paul Skeaping (1953).\n Hepworth was especially active within, and on behalf of, the modernist artistic community in St Ives during its period of post-war international prominence. Her experience of the Cornish landscape was acknowledged in her choice of titles. In a wider context, Hepworth also represented a link with pre-war ideals in a climate of social and physical reconstruction; this was exemplified by her two sculptures for the South Bank site of the Festival of Britain (1951). Public commissions and greater demand encouraged her to employ assistants for preliminary work - including Denis Mitchell and Dicon Nance - and to produce bronze editions.\n  Hepworth's international standing was confirmed by the Grand Prix of the 1959 S\u00e3o Paolo Bienal, which came amid honorary degrees, the CBE (1958) and the DBE (1965), and a second Whitechapel exhibition (1962) and a European tour (1964). In 1964, Single Form was erected outside the United Nations building, New York as a memorial to the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. Hepworth served as a Tate trustee (1965-72), donating six works in 1964 and a further nine in 1967 prior to the 1968 retrospective at the Gallery. The catalogue raisonn\u00e9 by Alan Bowness (the sculptor's son-in-law) included in J.P. Hodin's 1961 monograph was extended in 1971. With her long-standing friend the potter Bernard Leach, she was awarded the Freedom of St Ives in 1968 as an acknowledgement of her importance to the town. After a long battle with cancer, she died there on 20 May 1975 in a horrific fire at her home. The studio was designated the Barbara Hepworth Museum in the following year and, on coming under the Tate's aegis in 1980, secured an unrivalled collection of her work for the Gallery. Since then, scholarly interest has focused on her status as one of the few women artists to achieve international prominence.\nMatthew Gale April 1997\n\nBibliography:\nHerbert Read, Barbara Hepworth: Carvings and Drawings, London 1952\nJ.P.

In 1805 he entered the Royal Academy Schools. He participated in the naturalist movement of the early nineteenth century, making oil sketches from nature along the Thames. His friendship with Cornelius Varley led in 1811\u201312 to his entry into the Baptist church and a more intense interest in humble landscapes, often including labourers at work. In the following decade he made several sketching tours and produced remarkably fresh watercolour sketches. He exhibited his oils at the Society of Painters in Oil and Water-Colours in 1813\u201320. With his marriage in 1817 and the onset of family responsibilities, he turned his attention to portraiture. \nLinnell became more extreme in his views and eccentric in his habits. His eccentricity led to rifts with other artists and may account for his failure to be elected to the Royal Academy.\nIn the mid 1840s Linnell's increasing prosperity enabled him to give up portraiture, and from 1851, when he settled at Redhill, Surrey, he specialised in rural landscapes. His patrons, however, preferred pastorals, which Linnell was able to see as \u2018poetical' by giving them religious significance, and his later landscapes \u2013 which became increasingly sketchy and repetitive \u2013 sold for high prices. His reputation declined after his death, but his work began to be reassessed in the 1970s, with the emphasis being placed on the more inspired, sometimes visionary, early landscapes.\nBibliographyArtist's estate [Journals (1811, 1817\u201379), unfinished autobiography (1863) and account books]London, BM, 1976\u20131\u201331\u20136/7 [Landscape and Portrait Sketchbooks, which contain a record of most of his paintings]CHRISTIANA PAYNE\n                ", "date": "1814", "acquisition": "Purchased 1981"},

His treatment of the human figure, in terms of angular, clear-cut forms charged with enormous energy, reveals his determination to bring about a drastic renewal in British painting.\nThe direction taken by his art brought him into contact with Wyndham Lewis and the Vorticists, but Bomberg resisted Lewis's attempts to enlist him as a member of the movement. \nWith the advent of World War I, everything changed dramatically. By November 1915 Bomberg had enlisted in the Royal Engineers, and his harrowing experiences at the Front brought about a profound transformation in his outlook.\nBomberg never again returned to this dogged and limiting idiom, but he did explore a radically different path during the 1920s. His disillusion with the destructive power of the machine at war led to a few years spent experimenting with ways of making his stark pre-war style more rounded and organic. \nThroughout the 1930s Bomberg's art became broader and more impassioned as he sought to convey the essence of his response to landscapes in Scotland and Spain.  This work met with little approval in Britain, and during World War II his outstanding series of Bomb Store paintings did not lead to further commissions from the War Artists Committee, despite his repeated requests. His last years were darkened by the realization that his art remained overlooked and even belittled in Britain. His final landscapes and figure paintings include some of his most powerful works.\nBibliographyDavid Bomberg, 1890\u20131957 (exh. cat. by A. Forge, W. Lipke and D. Sylvester, ACGB, 1967)W.

Sweep to Victory graphically depicts the processes of Scrapheap Services, but here the mannequins of the installation who carry out sinister 'cleansing' activities are virtually submerged by Landy's stylised rendering of discarded wrappers for crisps, juice, peanuts, chocolates, McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, beer and soft drink cans and so on. Virtually every inch of the paper is covered in careful drawing, punctuated by slogans from the video in the installation, together with handwritten transcripts of newspaper articles 'rubbishing' contemporary art, letters seeking funding or sponsorship in kind for the making of the installation, and instructions for use from home improvement materials such as paints, lino paste, acrylic filler and fluorescent battens. Even the installation's two signboards appear in the drawing, with letters to indicate colour fields as though they were from a child's colouring-in book. The giant 'Vulture' people-shredder of the installation appears in the top half of the drawing, with the Scrapheap Services logo on the pile of shredded men underneath, but here it is drastically reduced in scale. The drawing is dominated by the flood of rubbish over which representations of the installation's little cut-out men float chaotically. \n\nLandy intended the installation Scrapheap Services to be set in a sterile and alienating environment created by white walls and fluorescent lighting to emphasise that the rubbish will be ruthlessly eradicated. By contrast, Sweep to Victory seems to represent (ironically, given its title) the ultimate victory of the rubbish. The eye-catching logos of commercial goods leap out from the page and dwarf the frenetic activities - letter writing, preparations for DIY, rubbish disposal - going on in between. More ambiguous than the installation, the drawing represents in two dimensions all the elements of its three dimensional version on the equalising level of a single sheet of paper.\n\nFurther reading:Michael Landy, Scrapheap Services, London 1996Brilliant!

The unbroken lines that make up many elements of the composition \u2013 the ear of the woman and the hairline of the man, for instance \u2013 perhaps suggest the playful experiments of an experienced draughtsman, while their fluid rhythms might be seen to complement the sensuality of the subject matter.\nAccording to the art historian Jean Leymarie, such qualities \u2013 an increased focus on \u2018love themes\u2019, and the \u2018freedom and unpredictability of his line\u2019 \u2013 were characteristic of Picasso\u2019s works on paper at this time (Jean Leymarie, Picasso: The Artist of the Century, New York 1972, p.281). For the writer Michel Leiris, they were also present in drawings executed earlier that year, containing couples \u2018with love in mind: about to make it, in the act of making it, or just having made it\u2019 (Michel Leiris, Picasso, Dessins 1966-67, Paris 1968, p.3). Viewed as a variation on a particular motif, however, The Kiss is harder to place. It originates from a sequence of similar studies made on 7 October 1967, but Picasso would not revisit and elaborate upon the motif for a full year (the resulting oil paintings and sketches generating such scandal over their explicit nature that they had to be hung in the highest part of the Palace of the Popes, Avignon, when they were shown there in 1970).\nPicasso often sourced images from previous works kept in his studio, leading his friend and biographer Roland Penrose to observe that \u2018when he draws, Picasso is surrounded by a multitude of figures that have been familiars for years\u2019 (Penrose 1981, p.268). This may provide one way of situating The Kiss within Picasso\u2019s pictorial development. The couple in this work appear to be closely related to the titular figures of the Artist and his Model series, comprised of 180 drawings executed by Picasso in 1954\u20135 (and which he also revisited with Suite 347, a series of 347 prints begun in March 1968). The couple share the same basic features as the bearded sculptor and his muse in the Artist and his Model, but they might perhaps be viewed as archetypes rather than direct quotations. In The Kiss, they are tightly framed, allowing Picasso to focus on details, such as their overlapping tongues, that draw out the energy and physicality of an intimate moment. These nuances may also provoke questions about the nature of their embrace, with the narrowed eyes of the man and tilted angle of the woman\u2019s head possibly carrying the suggestion of sexual violence.\nThis work was bequeathed to Tate upon the death of its owner, Joanna Drew (1929\u20132003), and the artist\u2019s inscriptions \u2013 visible in the upper-right corner of the drawing \u2013 provide clues as to its provenance. Following Picasso\u2019s customary system, the drawing is specified as the fourth work completed on 7 October 1967. Underneath, it is inscribed in pencil to Drew and dated 22 January 1968.\nDrew was employed by the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1952, and had served as an exhibition organiser for Picasso retrospectives directed by Roland Penrose and held at the Tate Gallery in 1960 and 1967. Picasso, however, did not attend either exhibition, and it was not until January 1968 that Drew would meet him. As the Arts Council\u2019s official courier, she accompanied Penrose and his wife Lee Miller to Picasso\u2019s home in Mougins in the south of France to supervise the unpacking of works he lent to Hommage \u00e0 Picasso (the Paris exhibition organised to coincide with his eighty-fifth birthday in 1966, and which travelled to New York later that year). In her commentary on Penrose\u2019s notebooks and letters, art historian Elizabeth Cowling explains that both he and Miller were given drawings contemporary with The Kiss \u2013 and bearing near-identical inscriptions \u2013 on 22 January. Cowling also quotes Drew\u2019s account of Picasso\u2019s wife Jacqueline offering the artist\u2019s \u2018favourite Tintin book\u2019 when asked to find something he could inscribe to Drew (quoted in Elizabeth Cowling, Visiting Picasso: The Notebooks and Letters of Roland Penrose, London 2006, p.313). It is likely that it was at this time that Picasso selected the finished work from his studio, and gifted Drew The Kiss.\n\nFurther reading\nYvonne Zervos, Pablo Picasso, 1969\u201370, Paris 1970.Roland Penrose, \u2018Some Recent Drawings by Picasso\u2019, in Marilyn McCully (ed.), A Picasso Anthology: Documents, Criticism, Reminiscences, Princeton 1981, pp.268\u201370.Marie-Laure Bernadac, \u2018Picasso 1953\u20131972: Painting as Model\u2019, in Late Picasso: Paintings, Sculpture, Drawings, Prints 1953\u20131972, exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery, London 1988, pp.49\u201394.\nJonathan VernonJanuary 2014\n\nSupported by Christie\u2019s.\n\n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Graphite on paper", "dimensions": "Support: 505 x 655 mm", "reference": "T12203", "title": "The Kiss", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-the-kiss-t12203", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12203_8.jpg", "artist": "Pablo Picasso", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1881\u20131973", "date": "1967", "acquisition": "Bequeathed by Joanna Drew 2003, accessioned 2006"},

The right hand marginal  text, from the Book of Job, describes Behemoth,  who dominates the land, as 'the chief of the Ways  of God.' Leviathan, a Sea Monster, is 'King over  all the Children of Pride.' In his book  'Jerusalem' Blake has these two monsters  representatives of war by land and by sea.

She arrived in New York in 1939. From 1954 to 1957 she studied at Cooper Union in New York and in 1959 at Yale University School of Art in New Haven, CT, under Josef Albers. Her individual style first appeared in drawings shown in the early 1960s, for example at her first one-woman exhibition at Allan Stone Gallery in New York (1963). Hesse considered herself a painter until 1965, when, during a year in Germany, she constructed and exhibited 14 papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 reliefs, with cord-wrapped wires embedded, projecting or dangling from them, at the Kunsthalle, D\u00fcsseldorf; among these exhibited works was Tomorrow's Apples (5 in White) (1965; London, Tate). Hesse's friends included Sol LeWitt, Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt (b 1938), Mel Bochner (b 1940) and Dan Graham.\nIn the years before her early death Hesse's sculpture grew in scale and daring from easel-sized reliefs to Expanded Expansion (1969; New York, Guggenheim), whose latex-covered cheesecloth \u2018curtains', draped between 16 plexiglass poles (h. 3.1 m), are extendable laterally, and Right After (1969; Milwaukee, WI, A. Mus.), whose light-filled fibreglass strands are suspended irregularly in space, usually up to c. 5 m wide. Her mature sculpture abounds in contradictions: chaos and order, organic and geometric, absurd and tragic. Hesse was one of the first and most influential artists to question the austere, immobile exactitude of serial Minimalism and imbue it with a capacity to move, change and vary from the norm like a living being.\nBibliographyOberlin Coll., OH, Allen Mem.

He was never a naturally fluid draughtsman, and he never achieved any great dramatic force. In 1871 Walker designed his famous poster for the stage adaptation of Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White. His dramatic image of Anne Catherick, swathed in a cloak and seen full length from behind, is generally considered the first successful modern pictorial poster and anticipates many similar designs of the 1890s. Walker himself believed that the designing of posters could become \u2018a most important branch of art'.\nAs a painter in watercolours and oils Walker began to enjoy success from about 1863 onwards. Walker employed a meticulous and heavily worked gouache technique that owed much to William Henry Hunt and Myles Birket Forster. \nWalker's study of the Antique as a student led him to rely on the formal conventions of antique sculpture in his oil paintings. \nTo Victorian eyes Walker seemed a sincere and unsentimental observer of rustic life. His paintings were considered sensitive portrayals of rural landscape and life. Walker's agreeable character and his early death from tuberculosis sustained his posthumous reputation, and he was an important influence on young British painters working in the 1870s and 1880s. But the idealised and sentimental quality of much of his work engendered subsequent critical neglect. \nBibliographyDNBC. Phillips: Frederick Walker, Port. Monographs A. Subjects, vi (1894)J. G.

During 1946 and 1947, his last year at the Slade School of Art, he began using such images in a series of collages which, according to Paolozzi, were heavily indebted to Pablo Picasso's (1881-1973) synthetic Cubism of c.1912-18. In the summer of 1947, while still an undergraduate, the Mayor Gallery, London, held Paolozzi's first one-man exhibition. Its success allowed him to leave the Slade and live in Paris. It was there, possibly in his flat on the Ile St Louis, that Real Gold was made.\n\nThe collage is made up of images from popular American magazines, which Paolozzi procured from American ex-servicemen, many of whom were studying in Paris as a result of an initiative by the United States government known as the GI Bill. In the context of his own poverty and the general deprivation that affected all of Europe in the years immediately after the Second World War (1939-45), it is not surprising that Paolozzi was seduced by the 'exotic society, bountiful and generous' (Eduardo Paolozzi, 'Retrospective statements' in Robbins, p.192) that he saw presented in American magazines. In Real Gold images of healthy, happy people enjoying the freedom afforded by such machines as modern cars and bikes are interspersed with such other new, liberating inventions as the portable radio and the electric kettle. On the right side is a can of Real Gold orange juice, the product from which the collage takes it title. The Real Gold logo appears in several of Paolozzi's collages from this time, and a year later he used the title again for one of his Bunk collages (Tate T01460). \n\nIt was not, however, just the suggestion of material well-being which attracted Paolozzi to these images. He was equally struck by their artistic value and their status as the new iconography of the modern world. In his opinion, the aesthetic of American advertisements and popular magazines was one 'where the event of selling tinned pears was transformed into multi-coloured dreams, where sensuality and virility combined to form, in our view, an art form more subtle and fulfilling than the orthodox choice of either the Tate Gallery or the Royal Academy' (Eduardo Paolozzi, 'Retrospective statements' in Robbins, p.192). \n\nReal Gold and similar works by Paolozzi from this period have often been cited as the forerunners of Pop Art in Britain. Although there is a clear correspondence with ideas that were later to become associated with Pop Art, Paolozzi himself was responding to Dadaism and Surrealism. Before he left Britain in 1947 he was familiar with the collages of Max Ernst (1891-1976) and Roland Penrose (1900-1984), among others, and once in Paris he had access to Mary Reynolds's and Tristan Tzara's (1896-1963) collections of Dadaist and Surrealist work. The surprising juxtaposition of familiar objects was a central strategy of both groups, and one that is apparent in Paolozzi's collages of the late 1940s.\n\nFurther reading:Eduardo Paolozzi: Sculpture, Drawings, Collages and Graphics, exhibition catalogue, Arts Council of Great Britain, London 1976David Robbins (ed.), The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty, exhibition catalogue, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London 1990, pp.94-108 and 192-193, reproduced p.99, cat.no.50 (colour)\n\nToby TrevesApril 2001\n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n              \n            ", "medium": "Printed papers on paper", "dimensions": "Support: 282 x 410 mm", "reference": "T06934", "title": "Real Gold", "url": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-real-gold-t06934", "image": "http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T06/T06934_8.jpg", "artist": "Sir Eduardo Paolozzi", "collection": "\n        Tate\n        ", "artistlife": " 1924\u20132005", "date": "1949", "acquisition": "Presented by the artist 1995"},

The novel is set in sixteenth-century Pomerania and chronicles the crimes of the evil Sidonia, whose beauty captivates all who see her.
